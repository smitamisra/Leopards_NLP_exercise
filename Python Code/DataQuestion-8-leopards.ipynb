BUSINESS\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company (the Company, BHGE, we, us, or our), a Delaware corporation, was\\nformed on October 28, 2016, for the purpose of facilitating the combination of Baker Hughes Incorporated, a\\nDelaware corporation (Baker Hughes), and the oil and gas business (GE O&G) of General Electric Company\\n(GE).\\nOn July 3, 2017, we closed our business combination (the Transactions) to\\ncombine GE O&G and Baker Hughes creating a fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of\\nintegrated equipment and service capabilities (refer to \"Note 2. Business Acquisition\" of the Notes to the\\nConsolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further details on the Transactions). As a\\nresult of the Transactions, the Company became the holding company of the combined businesses of Baker Hughes\\nand GE O&G. Substantially all of the business of GE O&G and of Baker Hughes was transferred to a\\nsubsidiary of the Company, Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC (BHGE LLC), on July 3, 2017. GE has\\napproximately 62.5% of economic interest in BHGE LLC and the\\nCompany has approximately 37.5% of the remaining economic\\ninterest in BHGE LLC, held indirectly through two wholly owned subsidiaries. One of these wholly owned\\nsubsidiaries of the Company is the sole managing member of BHGE LLC. Although we hold a minority economic\\ninterest in BHGE LLC, we conduct and exercise full control over all activities of BHGE LLC, without the\\napproval of any other member, through this wholly owned subsidiary. Accordingly, we consolidate the financial\\nresults of BHGE LLC and report a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated and combined financial statements\\nfor the economic interest in BHGE LLC not held by us. We are a holding company and have no material assets\\nother than our ownership interest in BHGE LLC and certain intercompany and tax related balances. BHGE LLC is a\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Registrant with separate filing requirements with the SEC and its\\nseparate financial information can be obtained from www.sec.gov.\\nThe Transactions were treated as a \"reverse acquisition\" for accounting purposes and, as such,\\nthe historical financial statements of the accounting acquirer, GE O&G, are the historical financial\\nstatements of the Company. The Company\\'s financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis,\\neffective July 3, 2017. For all periods prior to July 3, 2017, the Company\\'s financial statements were prepared\\non a combined basis. The combined financial statements combine certain accounts of GE and its subsidiaries that\\nwere historically managed as part of its oil & gas business. The historical financial results in the\\ncombined financial statements presented may not be indicative of the results that would have been achieved had\\nGE O&G operated as a separate, stand-alone entity during those periods. The GE O&G numbers in the\\nconsolidated and combined statements of income (loss) and statements of cash flows have been reclassified to\\nconform to the current presentation. We believe that the current presentation is a more appropriate\\npresentation of the combined businesses.\\nOUR VISION\\nWe are the only fullstream provider of integrated oilfield products, services and digital\\nsolutions with 2017 revenue of $17.3 billion and a presence in more than 120 countries. We strive to provide\\nbest-in-class physical and digital technology solutions for customer productivity, leveraging complementary\\ntechnologies to serve customers across the full spectrum of the oil and gas value chain.\\nWe believe that there are structural changes taking place in the oil and gas industry that\\nrequire a change in how we work. No matter the oil price, our customers are looking for new models and\\nsolutions to deliver higher industrial yield, which means improving productivity and efficiency and leveraging\\neconomies of scale, with lower carbon impact. While we will continue to serve customers on a project basis, our\\nfullstream portfolio, digital capabilities and leading technology and services will enable us to shift towards\\noutcome-focused solutions, enabling customers to lower capital and operating costs, reduce non-productive time\\nand boost resource recovery. This is the cornerstone of our corporate strategy that is based on three\\npillars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nWe intend to build market leading product companies focused on comprehensively reducing\\nproduct and service costs, while improving equipment efficiency and reliability to significantly lower project\\nbreakeven costs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nWe strive to create value through integrated and differentiated equipment and service modules\\nthat will impact our customers total cost of projects and operations as well as fundamentally improving\\nindustry productivity, and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nWe plan to continue to develop fullstream opportunities that drive value creation through\\nradical improvements in total cost reduction and productivity increases for the industry.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe expect to benefit from the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nComplete fullstream portfolio.  Leading portfolio\\ncapable of serving upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry, matching oilfield\\nservice and equipment leaders in many areas. Our four product lines - Oilfield Services; Oilfield Equipment;\\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions; and Digital Solutions, as discussed below under \"Products and\\nServices,\" are each among the top four providers in their respective segments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nComplementary technology.  We have a culture built\\non a heritage of innovation and invention in research and development, with complementary capabilities.\\nTechnology remains a differentiator and enables us to deliver across the value chain. Given our breadth and\\ndepth, we can leverage our technology, talent and expertise across our portfolio to accelerate the pace of\\ninnovation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nDigital capabilities.  We expect to be able to\\ncontinue to develop software offerings on any operating platform, for new and extended applications in the oil\\nand gas and other industrial ecosystems, such as machine and equipment health, reliability management and\\nmaintenance optimization.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe believe we are positioned to assist our customers as they balance investment decisions\\nbetween greenfield projects, brownfield projects and optimizing existing assets as a result of the current\\nmacroeconomic environment and the potentially prolonged period of lower oil prices. We expect that aging fields\\nwill require increased maintenance and intervention to sustain production later into the well life cycle when\\ndepletion accelerates. We believe our strategy coupled with our capabilities will help us compete and win in\\nthe current environment, while positioning us for the future.\\nORDERS AND BACKLOG\\nWe are a global business with consolidated 2017 revenue of\\n$17,259 million. We generate revenue and orders from a combination\\nof equipment sales and services. In 2017, 42% of revenue was generated from equipment sales and 58% from\\nservices, while 39% of orders were for equipment and 61% for services. In 2016 and 2015, 46% and 50% of revenue\\nwas generated from equipment sales, and 54% and 50% of revenue was from services, respectively. We recognized\\norders of $17,376 million, $11,273\\nmillion, and $15,385 million,\\nrespectively, in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Due to the nature of our business, including the time required to\\nmanufacture equipment and the long-term nature of many of its service contracts, there is a backlog of unfilled\\ncustomer orders for equipment sales and services, which as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled\\n$21,022 million, $21,697\\nmillion, and $23,941 million,\\nrespectively.\\nOur statement of income (loss) displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with SEC\\nregulations under which \"goods\" is required to include all sales of tangible products and \"services\" must\\ninclude all other sales, including other services activities. For the amounts shown above, as well as in the\\norders and backlog charts included in Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\\nof Operations included in Item 7 in this Form 10-K, we distinguish between \"equipment\" and \"product services,\"\\nwhere product services refers to sales under product services agreements, including sales of both goods (such\\nas spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs),\\nwhich is an important part of its operations. We refer to \"product services\" simply as \"services\" within this\\nBusiness section and the Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nincluded in Item 7 in this Form 10-K.\\nBacklog is defined as unfilled customer orders for products and services believed to be firm.\\nFor product services, an amount is included for the expected life of the contract.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 2\\n\\n\\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES \\nWe are a fullstream provider of oilfield products, services and digital solutions. Following\\nthe Transactions, we revised our segment structure and began to manage and report our operating results through\\nfour operating segments - Oilfield Services, Oilfield Equipment, Turbomachinery & Processing Solutions, and\\nDigital Solutions. Our operating segments are organized based on the nature of our markets and customers. We\\nhave reflected this revised structure for all historical periods presented.

Management\\'s Discussion and\\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and \"Note 15. Segment Information\" of the Notes to\\nConsolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\\nMARKETS AND COMPETITION\\nWe sell to our customers through direct and indirect channels. Our primary sales channel is\\nthrough our direct sales force, which has a strong regional focus with local teams close to the customer, who\\nare able to draw support from centers of excellence in each of our major product lines. Our sales force also\\nuses its application engineers, field application engineers, service engineers, commercial and sales managers,\\nand account executives to help deliver and provide customers with the best product and service solutions which\\nBHGE can offer. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in the current year.\\nOur products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and the competitive\\nenvironment varies by produce line, as discussed below:\\nOilfield Services\\nOur OFS product line believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and\\nmarkets it serves are product and service quality, reliability and availability, health, safety and\\nenvironmental standards, technical proficiency and price. Our products and services are sold in highly\\ncompetitive markets and revenue and earnings are affected by changes in commodity prices, fluctuations in the\\nlevel of drilling, workover and completion activity in major markets, general economic conditions, foreign\\ncurrency exchange fluctuations and governmental regulations. While we may have contracts with customers that\\ninclude multiple well projects and that may extend over a period of time ranging from two to four years, our\\nservices and products are generally provided on a well-by-well basis. Most contracts cover our pricing of the\\nproducts and services, but do not necessarily establish an obligation to use our products and services. OFS\\nproduct line competitors include Schlumberger, Halliburton and Weatherford International.\\nOilfield Equipment\\nOur OFE product line believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and\\nmarkets it serves are product and service quality, reliability and on time delivery, health, safety and\\nenvironmental standards, technical proficiency, availability of spare parts and price. Its strong track record\\nof innovation enables OFE to enter into long-term, performance-based service agreements with our customers. In\\nthe SPS product line, the primary competitors of OFE include Schlumberger, TechnipFMC, Aker Solutions ASA,\\nProserv and Dril-Quip Inc. In the flexible pipe product line, competitors include TechnipFMC, National Oilwell\\nVarco (NOV), Airborne, and Magma. In the drilling sub-product line, competitors include NOV, Schlumberger and\\nHorn Equipment.\\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\\nOur TPS product line believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and\\nmarkets it serves are product range (or power range measured in Megawatts) coverage, efficiency, product\\nreliability and availability, service capabilities, packages, references, emissions and price. In upstream and\\nmidstream applications, our primary equipment competitors include Siemens (Power and Gas business unit), Solar\\n(a Caterpillar company), MAN Turbo and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. In downstream applications, TPS primarily\\ncompetes with OEMs and independent service providers, including Flowserve, Pentair, Emerson, Siemens, Hitachi,\\nSolar (a Caterpillar company), Ariel, MAN Turbo, Burckhardt, Elliott Ebara and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Our\\naftermarket equipment product line competes with smaller independent local providers such as Masaood John\\nBrown, Sulzer, MTU, Trans Canada Turbine, Chromalloy and Ethos Energy (a joint venture of Siemens and the Wood\\nGroup).\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 5\\n\\n\\nDigital Solutions\\nOur DS product line believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and\\nmarkets it serves are superior product technology, service, quality, and reliability. Our DS product line\\ncompetes across a wide range of industries, including Oil & Gas, Power Generation, Aerospace, and Light and\\nHeavy Industrials. The products and services are sold in a diversified, fragmented arena with a broad range of\\ncompetitors. Although no single company competes directly with DS across all its product lines, various\\ncompanies compete in one or more products. Primary competitors include Emerson, ABB, Schneider Electric,\\nFortive, Olympus, Comet Group, Honeywell Process Solutions, Roper Technology, Siemens, Spectris, Aspentech and\\nOSISoft.\\nCONTRACTS\\nWe conduct our business under various types of contracts in the upstream, midstream, and\\ndownstream segments, including fixed-fee or turnkey contracts, transactional agreements for products and\\nservices, and long-term aftermarket service agreements.\\nWe enjoy stable relationships with many of our customers based on long-term project contracts\\nand master service agreements. Several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the\\ncustomer\\'s technical specifications with little or no legal relief available due to changes in circumstances,\\nsuch as changes in local laws or industry or geopolitical events. In some cases, failure to deliver products or\\nperform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims. We seek to mitigate\\nthese exposures through close collaboration with our customers.\\nWe strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to\\nbe industry best practices. Our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from: the injury or\\ndeath of their employees and often their other contractors; the loss of or damage to their equipment and often\\nthat of their other contractors; pollution originating from their equipment or facility; and all liabilities\\nrelated to the well and subsurface operations, including loss or damage to the well or reservoir, loss of well\\ncontrol, fire, explosion, or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas. Conversely, we typically indemnify our\\ncustomers for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of our employees and sometimes that of our\\nsubcontractors; the loss of or damage to our equipment (other than equipment lost in the hole); and pollution\\noriginating from our equipment above the surface of the earth while in our care, custody, and control. Where\\nthe above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices, we typically provide a\\ncapped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence or the negligence of our contractors, and\\ninclude an overall limitation of liability clause. It is also our general practice to include a limitation of\\nliability for consequential loss, including loss of profits and loss of revenue, in all customer\\ncontracts.\\nOur indemnity structure may not protect us in every case. Certain U.S. states such as Texas,\\nLouisiana, Wyoming, and New Mexico have enacted oil and natural gas specific anti-indemnity statutes. These\\nstatutes can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract, however, both the Texas and Louisiana\\nanti-indemnity statutes include important exclusions. The Louisiana statute does not apply to property damage,\\nand the Texas statute allows mutual indemnity agreements that are supported by insurance and has exclusions,\\nwhich include, among other things, loss or liability for property damage that results from pollution and the\\ncost of well control events. State law, laws or public policy in countries outside the U.S., or the negotiated\\nterms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of the gross negligence or\\nwillful misconduct. We sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products. It is our\\npractice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any end-user claims, but this is not always\\npossible. Similarly, government agencies and other third parties, including in some cases other contractors of\\nour customers, may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and for which responsibility is\\nassessed proportionate to fault. In all cases, deviations from our standard contracting practices are examined\\nthrough an established risk deviation process.\\nThe Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers\\nagainst certain operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims, as well as\\ncertain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of\\ncontact with pollution for which the Company is liable, however, clean up and well control costs are not\\ncovered by such program. All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible\\nand/or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment, specific terms, conditions,\\nlimitations and exclusions. There can be no\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 6\\n\\n\\nassurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully\\nindemnify us against liabilities related to our business.\\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\\nWe engage in research and development activities directed primarily toward\\nthe development of new products, services, technology and other solutions, as well as the improvement of\\nexisting products and services and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs. For\\ninformation regarding the total amount of research and development expense in each of the three years in the\\nperiod ended December 31, 2017, see \"Note 1. Summary of\\nSignificant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8\\nherein.\\nIn the OFS and OFE product lines, we continue to invest in products to develop capability,\\nimprove performance and reduce costs. In OFS, we invested in a range of formation evaluation capabilities and\\ndrilling services hardware. This included a new and cutting-edge line of drill bits with hydraulic actuators\\nthat offer customers improvements in reliability, efficiency and maintainability. In OFE, the recent focus has\\nbeen to expand capability into deeper water, longer offsets and at higher pressures. Additionally, subsea power\\nand processing is also an area in which we are investing, covering both pumping and compression. In the TPS\\nproduct line, we continue to invest in continuous product improvement of reciprocating and centrifugal\\ncompressors, using advanced fluid dynamic simulation and advanced aeromechanics to improve capability,\\noperability and efficiency of its centrifugal compressors family. DS continues to invest in advanced digital\\nsolutions designed to improve the efficiency, reliability and safety of oil and gas production operations.\\nThese systems integrate operational data from producing oil and gas facilities to deliver notifications and\\nanalytical reports to engineers so they can identify operational performance issues before they become\\nsignificant, thus helping to prevent unplanned downtime and improve facility reliability.\\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\\nOur technology, brands and other intellectual property rights are important elements of our\\nbusiness. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure and employee\\ninvention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Many of the patents and patent\\napplications in our portfolio are owned by us, while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio are\\nlicensed to us by GE and third parties. We do not consider any individual patent or trademark to be material to\\nour business operations.\\nIn connection with the Transactions, GE entered into an IP cross-license agreement (the IP\\nCross-License Agreement) with BHGE LLC. GE agreed to perpetually license to BHGE LLC the right to use certain\\nintellectual property owned or controlled by GE (other than GE Digital) pursuant to the terms of the IP\\nCross-License Agreement. BHGE LLC agreed to perpetually license to GE the right to use certain intellectual\\nproperty rights pursuant to the terms of the IP Cross-License Agreement. This license allows BHGE LLC to have\\ncontinued rights to use some of GE\\'s intellectual property so that they can be leveraged pursuant to the terms\\nof the IP Cross-License Agreement. Any improvements to such intellectual property made or developed by BHGE LLC\\nwill be owned by BHGE LLC and licensed back to GE pursuant to the terms of the IP Cross-License Agreement and\\nany improvements to such intellectual property made or developed by GE will be owned by GE and licensed to BHGE\\nLLC. If we were to cease being a majority-owned subsidiary of GE, the licenses under the IP Cross-License\\nAgreement are intended to survive.\\nWe have followed a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and\\nregions throughout the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. We believe\\nthat protection of our patents, trademarks, and related intellectual property rights is central to the conduct\\nof our business, and aggressively pursue protection of our intellectual property rights against infringement\\nworldwide as we deem appropriate to protect our business. Additionally, we consider the quality and timely\\ndelivery of our products, the service we provide to our customers and the technical knowledge and skills of our\\npersonnel to be other important components of the portfolio of capabilities and assets supporting our ability\\nto compete.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 7\\n\\n\\nSEASONALITY\\nOur operations can be affected by seasonal weather, which can temporarily affect the delivery\\nand performance of our products and services, and our customers\\' budgetary cycles. Examples of seasonal events\\nthat can impact our business are set forth below:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nThe severity and duration of both the summer and the winter in North America can have a\\nsignificant impact on activity levels. In Canada, the timing and duration of the spring thaw directly affects\\nactivity levels, which reach seasonal lows during the second quarter and build through the third and fourth\\nquarters to a seasonal high in the first quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nAdverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, may interrupt or curtail\\nour coastal and offshore drilling, or our customers\\' operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss\\nof revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nSevere weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the\\nNorth Sea and Russia generally in the first quarter and may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our\\ncustomers\\' operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nScheduled repair and maintenance of offshore facilities in the North Sea can reduce activity\\nin the second and third quarters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nMany of our international oilfield customers increase orders for certain products and services\\nin the fourth quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nOur process & pipeline business in the DS segment typically experiences lower sales during\\nthe first and fourth quarters of the year due to the Northern Hemisphere winter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nOur broader DS business typically experiences higher customer activity as a result of spending\\npatterns in the second half of the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nRAW MATERIALS\\nWe purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products\\nand delivering our services.  The principal raw materials we use include steel alloys, chromium, nickel,\\ntitanium, barite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten carbide, synthetic and natural diamonds, gels, sand and\\nother proppants, printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbon-based chemical feed\\nstocks.  Raw materials that are essential to our business are normally readily available from multiple sources,\\nbut may be subject to price volatility.  Market conditions can trigger constraints in the supply of certain raw\\nmaterials, and we are always seeking ways to ensure the availability and manage the cost of raw materials.  Our\\nprocurement department uses its size and buying power to enhance its access to key materials at competitive\\nprices.\\nIn addition to raw materials and component parts, we also use the products and services of\\nmetal fabricators, machine shops, foundries, forge shops, assembly operations, contract manufacturers,\\nlogistics providers, packagers, indirect material providers, and others in order to produce and deliver\\nproducts to customers.  These materials and services are generally available from multiple sources.\\nEMPLOYEES\\nAs of December 31, 2017,\\nwe had over 64,000 employees, of which the majority are\\noutside the U.S. Approximately 11% of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or\\nsimilar-type labor arrangements.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 8\\n\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\\nWe are committed to the health and safety of people, protection of the environment and\\ncompliance with environmental laws, regulations and our policies. Our past and present operations include\\nactivities that are subject to extensive domestic (including U.S. federal, state and local) and international\\nregulations with regard to air, land and water quality and other environmental matters. Regulations continue to\\nevolve, and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations, as well as the enactment of new\\nlegislation, may require us and our customers to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to\\nchange or discontinue present methods of operation. Our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital\\ncosts for environmental control equipment may change accordingly.\\nWe are, and may in the future be, involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and\\nformer properties. On rare occasions, our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government\\nagency-issued consent decree or agreed order. Remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently\\navailable facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. For\\nsites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation, our cost estimates are developed based on\\ninternal evaluations and are not discounted. We record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated\\nto pay amounts for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such amounts can be\\nreasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of\\nthe remediation. Ongoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, installation\\nand maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal, are expensed as incurred.\\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (known as\\n\"Superfund\") imposes liability for the release of a \"hazardous substance\" into the environment. Superfund\\nliability is imposed without regard to fault, even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and\\nregulations. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at various Superfund sites, and\\nwe accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs for the site. PRPs in Superfund actions have joint and\\nseveral liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs.\\nIn some cases, it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because\\nthe projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage, or superfund allocation information is\\nnot yet available. Based upon current information, we believe that our overall compliance with environmental\\nregulations, including remediation obligations, environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for\\nenvironmental control equipment, will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings\\nor competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost, based on\\navailable information, is not expected to be material to our consolidated and combined financial statements.\\nOur total accrual for environmental remediation was $82 million and $28 million at December\\n31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We continue to focus on reducing future environmental\\nliabilities by maintaining appropriate Company standards and by improving our assurance programs.\\nAVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION FOR STOCKHOLDERS\\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current\\nreports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of\\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), are made available free of charge on our\\nInternet website at www.bhge.com as soon as reasonably\\npracticable after these reports have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

When considering an investment in\\nthe Company, one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below, as well as other\\ninformation included and incorporated by reference in this annual report. There may be additional risks,\\nuncertainties and matters not listed below, that we are unaware of, or that we currently consider immaterial.\\nAny of these may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and,\\nthus, the value of an investment in the Company.\\nRisk Factors Related to Our Business\\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which may adversely affect our ability to\\nsucceed.\\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield products and services\\nand securing equipment and trained personnel. Our ability to continually provide competitive products and\\nservices can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, maintain\\nmarket share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. In order to be competitive, we must\\nprovide new\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 11\\n\\n\\ntechnologies, reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value\\nfor our customers, and successfully recruit, train and retain competent personnel.\\nIn addition, our investments in new technologies and properties, plants and equipment may not\\nprovide competitive returns. Our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services\\nis in part dependent on the industry\\'s capacity relative to customer demand, and on our ability to\\ndifferentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors\\' products and services.\\nManaging development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at a\\nforecasted cost can impact our financial results. If we are unable to continue to develop and produce\\ncompetitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and cost-competitive manner in various markets\\nin which we operate, or if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or\\nservices, any competitive advantage that we may hold, and in turn, our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\\nThe high cost or unavailability of infrastructure, materials, equipment, supplies and\\npersonnel, particularly in periods of rapid growth, could adversely affect our ability to execute our\\noperations on a timely basis.\\nOur manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials, component parts\\nand manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing\\ninventories. Our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an\\nimpact on our business, including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals, control costs,\\nand avoid shortages or over-supply of raw materials and component parts. Raw materials and components of\\nparticular concern include steel alloys (including chromium and nickel), titanium, barite, beryllium, copper,\\nlead, tungsten carbide, synthetic and natural diamonds, gels, sand and other proppants, printed circuit boards\\nand other electronic components and hydrocarbon-based chemical feed stocks. Our ability to repair or replace\\nequipment damaged or lost in the well can also impact our ability to service our customers. A lack of\\nmanufacturing capacity could result in increased backlog, which may limit our ability to respond to orders with\\nshort lead times.\\nPeople are a key resource to developing, manufacturing and delivering our products and\\nservices to our customers around the world. Our ability to manage the recruiting, training, retention and\\nefficient usage of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could\\nimpact our business. A well-trained, motivated workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and\\nretain business. Periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit, train and\\nretain our employees, while also managing the impact of wage inflation and the limited available qualified\\nlabor in the markets where we operate.\\nLikewise, if the economy or markets decline or other changes occur, we may have to reduce\\nutilization of our assets or adjust our workforce to control costs, which may cause us to lose some of our\\nskilled employees. Labor-related actions, including strikes, slowdowns and facility occupations can also have a\\nnegative impact on our business.\\nOur business could be impacted by geopolitical and terrorism threats in countries where we or\\nour customers do business and our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest, government\\nexpropriations and/or epidemic outbreaks.\\nGeopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of key countries where we\\ncurrently or may in the future do business. Geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to, among other things,\\na loss of our investment in the country, impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our or our\\ncustomers\\' ability to conduct operations.\\nIn addition to other geopolitical and terrorism risks, civil unrest continues to grow in a\\nnumber of key countries where we do business. Our ability to conduct business operations may be impacted by\\nthat civil unrest and our assets in these countries may also be subject to expropriation by governments or\\nother parties involved in civil unrest. Epidemic outbreaks may also impact our business operations by, among\\nother things, restricting travel to protect the health and welfare of our employees and decisions by our\\ncustomers to curtail or stop operations in impacted areas.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 12\\n\\n\\nCompliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results. In\\naddition, government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.\\nWe have operations in the United States and in more than 120 countries that can be impacted by\\nexpected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate. Compliance-related\\nissues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries and impact our earnings. Changes that\\ncould impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations and\\nlegal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, in particular, changes in\\nexport control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to\\nsanctions, and changes in laws in countries where we operate. In addition, changes and uncertainty in the\\npolitical environments in which our businesses operate can have a material effect on the laws, rules, and\\nregulations that affect our operations. Government disruptions may also delay or halt the granting and renewal\\nof permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business. The continued\\nsuccess of our global business and operations depends, in part, on our ability to continue to anticipate and\\neffectively manage these and other political, legal and regulatory risks.\\nIncreased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and\\ntargeted computer crime could pose risks to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and\\ndata.\\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted\\ncyber-related attacks pose risks to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data.\\nCybersecurity attacks also pose risks to our customers\\', partners\\', suppliers\\' and third-party service\\nproviders\\' products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our and our\\ncustomers\\' data. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, we remain vulnerable to additional known or unknown\\nthreats. Given our global footprint, the large number of customers with which we do business, and the\\nincreasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of\\ntime without detection. We expect that any investigation of a cyber attack would be inherently unpredictable\\nand that it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full\\nand reliable information. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to\\nremediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and\\nremediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.\\nWe also may have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain\\nof our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls.\\nDespite our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we may be vulnerable to\\nmaterial security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or\\nmalfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or\\ninformation, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure,\\nmodification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational\\ndisruptions. In addition, a cyber-related attack could adversely impact our operating results and result in\\nother negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased\\nprotection costs, litigation or regulatory action.\\nOur failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other similar laws\\ncould have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.\\nOur ability to comply with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and various other anti-bribery and\\nanti-corruption laws depends on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to\\nsuccessfully manage our agents and business partners, and supervise, train and retain competent employees. Our\\ncompliance program depends on the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and our internal\\npolicies. We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, as well as fines and penalties,\\nin the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees.\\nAnti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws could have significant adverse\\nconsequences for us.\\nWe maintain an enterprise-wide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable\\nanti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the\\nPatriot Act. This program includes policies, procedures, processes and other internal controls designed to\\nidentify, monitor, manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our\\nproducts, services, customers and geographic locale. These controls establish procedures and processes to\\ndetect and report suspicious\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 13\\n\\n\\ntransactions, perform customer due diligence, respond to requests from law enforcement, and\\nmeet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or\\nmonetary instruments. We cannot be sure our programs and controls are or will remain effective to ensure our\\ncompliance with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, and our\\nfailure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions, fines, penalties and reputational harm, all of\\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\\ncondition.\\nChanges in tax laws or tax rates, adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax\\naudits could impact operating results.\\nChanges in tax laws or tax rates, changes in interpretation of tax laws, the resolution of tax\\nassessments or audits by various tax authorities, and the ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and\\ntax credits could impact our operating results, including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax\\nassets. In addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization. If taxing authorities were\\nto disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be\\nmaterially impacted. Our tax filings for various periods will be subject to audit by the tax authorities in\\nmost jurisdictions where we conduct business. For example, tax assessments have been received from various\\ntaxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals and/or litigation regarding these matters.\\nThese audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the\\ncourts. We believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations\\nof local tax law. Resolution of any tax matter involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the\\noutcomes will be favorable.\\nOur operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause\\nlosses.\\nThe products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex, and the failure\\nof our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers\\' costs. In\\naddition, many of these products are used in inherently hazardous industries, such as the offshore oilfield\\nbusiness. These hazards include blowouts, explosions, nuclear-related events, fires, collisions, capsizings and\\nsevere weather conditions. These hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or\\ndestruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations, as well\\nas adversely affect our brand and reputation which is a key asset to our business. We may incur substantial\\nliabilities or losses as a result of these hazards. While we maintain insurance protection against some of\\nthese risks, and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold us\\nharmless from some of these risks, our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or\\neffective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. The occurrence of a significant event,\\nagainst which we were not fully insured or indemnified or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification\\nobligations to us, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial\\ncondition.\\nCompliance with, and rulings and litigation in connection with, environmental regulations and\\nthe environmental impacts of our or our customers\\' operations may adversely affect our business and operating\\nresults.\\nWe and our business are impacted by material changes in environmental laws, regulations,\\nrulings and litigation. Our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and\\nour expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including (without limitation) our capital\\nexpenditures for environmental control equipment, are only our forecasts regarding these matters. These\\nforecasts may be substantially different from actual results, which may be affected by factors such as: changes\\nin law that impose restrictions on air emissions, wastewater management, waste disposal, hydraulic fracturing,\\nor wetland and land use practices; more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations; a\\nchange in our share of any remediation costs or other unexpected, adverse outcomes with respect to sites where\\nwe have been named as a potentially responsible party, including (without limitation) Superfund sites; the\\ndiscovery of other sites where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal\\nobligations; and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials.\\nInternational, national, and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and\\npromulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as\\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken\\nsteps to regulate GHG emissions as air pollutants under the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended. The EPA\\'s\\nGreenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from, among others, certain\\nmobile and stationary GHG emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry, which in turn may include data\\nfrom certain of\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 14\\n\\n\\nour wellsite equipment and operations. In addition, the U.S. government has proposed rules in\\nthe past setting GHG emission standards for, or otherwise aimed at reducing GHG emissions from, the oil and\\nnatural gas industry. Caps on carbon emissions, including in the United States, have been and may continue to\\nbe established and the cost of such caps could disproportionately affect the fossil-fuel energy sector. We are\\nunable to predict whether the proposed changes in laws or regulations ultimately will occur or what they\\nultimately will require, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact\\nthey may have on our business.\\nOther developments focused on restricting GHG emissions include the United Nations Framework\\nConvention on Climate Change, which includes the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol; the European Union\\nEmission Trading System; the United Kingdom\\'s CRC Energy Efficiency and ESOS schemes; and, in the United\\nStates, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Western Climate Action Initiative, and various state\\nprograms implementing the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (known as Assembly Bill 32).\\nCurrent or future legislation, regulations and developments, including those related to\\nclimate change, may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas in areas of the\\nworld where our customers operate, by shifting demand towards relatively lower carbon energy sources such as\\nwind, solar and other renewables. Many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies and\\npromoting technological research to support renewable energy sources, or are mandating the use of renewable\\nfuels or technologies. These governmental initiatives, as well as increased societal awareness of climate\\nchange impacts, have also resulted in increased investor and consumer demand for renewable energy. Any\\nresulting reduction in demand for oil and natural gas could adversely affect future demand for our services and\\nproducts, which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations.\\nUninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating\\nresults.\\nWe could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation, as well as unexpected litigation or\\nproceedings. While we have insurance coverage against operating hazards, including product liability claims and\\npersonal injury claims related to our products, to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the\\nextent insurance is available; no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be\\nsufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation.\\nThis insurance has deductibles or self-insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions. The\\ninsurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade\\npractices. In addition, the following risks apply with respect to our insurance coverage:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nwe may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nwe may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nour insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies; or\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nthe dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits.\\n\\n\\n\\nControl of oil and natural gas reserves by state-owned oil companies may impact the demand\\nfor our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.\\nMuch of the world\\'s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by state-owned oil companies.\\nState-owned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local\\nstandards, such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult\\nor undesirable for us to meet. The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may\\nadversely impact our operations in those countries. In addition, our ability to work with state-owned oil\\ncompanies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms.\\nProviding services on an integrated or turnkey basis could require us to assume additional\\nrisks.\\nMany state-owned oil companies and other operators may require integrated contracts or turnkey\\ncontracts and we may choose to provide services outside our core business. Providing services on an integrated\\nor turnkey basis may subject us to additional risks, such as costs associated with unexpected delays or\\ndifficulties in drilling or completion operations and risks associated with subcontracting arrangements.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 15\\n\\n\\nSome of our customers require bids in the form of long-term, fixed pricing contracts.\\nSome of our customers require bids for contracts in the form of long-term, fixed pricing\\ncontracts that may require us to provide integrated project management services outside our normal discrete\\nbusiness and to act as project managers, as well as service providers, and may require us to assume additional\\nrisks associated with cost over-runs. These customers may provide us with inaccurate information in relation to\\ntheir reserves. The estimation of reserves is a process that involves subjective judgment about likely location\\nand volume, and estimates that prove inaccurate may result in cost over-runs, delays, and project losses for us\\nor our customers, which may adversely impact our business.\\nProviding services on an integrated basis may also require us to assume additional risks\\nassociated with operating cost inflation, labor availability and productivity, supplier pricing and\\nperformance, and potential claims for liquidated damages. We typically rely on third-party subcontractors and\\nequipment providers to assist us with the completion of these types of contracts. To the extent that we cannot\\nengage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials in a timely manner and on reasonable terms, our ability\\nto complete a project in accordance with stated deadlines or at a profit may be impaired. If the amount we are\\nrequired to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed-price\\nwork, we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts. These delays and additional costs may\\nbe substantial and we may be required to compensate our customers for these delays. This may reduce the profit\\nto be realized or result in a loss on a project or harm to our relationships with our customers.\\nThe credit risks of having a concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result\\nin losses.\\nHaving a concentration of customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to\\ncredit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry\\nconditions. Some of our customers may experience extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity\\nprices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, which may affect our ability to\\nrecover any amounts due from such customers. Furthermore, countries that rely heavily upon income from\\nhydrocarbon exports have been and may in the future be negatively and significantly affected by a drop in oil\\nprices, which could affect our ability to collect from our customers in these countries, particularly national\\noil companies. Laws in some jurisdictions in which we will operate could make collection difficult or time\\nconsuming. We will perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not expect to require collateral\\nin support of our trade receivables. While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses, we cannot assure\\nsuch reserves will be sufficient to meet write-offs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such\\nreceivables will be consistent with our expectations. Additionally, in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our\\ncustomers, we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less, or none, of the\\namounts owed to us by such customer.\\nOur backlog is subject to modification, termination or reduction of orders, which could\\nnegatively impact our sales.\\nOur backlog is comprised of unfilled customer orders for products and\\nproduct services (expected life of contract sales for product services). Our backlog can be significantly\\naffected by the timing of orders for large projects. Although modifications and terminations of orders may be\\npartially offset by cancellation fees, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify orders. Our failure\\nto replace canceled orders could negatively impact our sales and results of operations. The total dollar amount\\nof the Company\\'s backlog as of December 31, 2017 was $21,022\\nmillion.\\nWe may not be able to satisfy technical requirements, testing requirements or other\\nspecifications required under our service contracts and equipment purchase agreements.\\nOur products are used in deepwater and other harsh environments and severe service\\napplications. Our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed\\nspecifications or technical requirements for our products and services, which may also include extensive\\ntesting requirements. We anticipate that such testing requirements will become more common in our contracts. In\\naddition, recent scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry has resulted in more stringent technical\\nspecifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure\\ncompliance with such specifications. We cannot provide assurance that our products will be able to satisfy the\\nspecifications or that we will be able to perform the full-scale testing necessary to prove that the product\\nspecifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts, or that the costs of\\nmodifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results\\nof operations. If our products are unable to satisfy such requirements, or we are unable\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 16\\n\\n\\nto perform any required full-scale testing, our customers may cancel their contracts and/or\\nseek new suppliers, and our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position may be adversely\\naffected.\\nCurrency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results.\\nFluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can impact our\\nrevenue and our costs of doing business, as well as the costs of doing business of our customers. Most of our\\nproducts and services are sold through contracts denominated in U.S. dollars or local currency indexed to U.S.\\ndollars, however, some of our revenue, local expenses and manufacturing costs are incurred in local currencies\\nand therefore changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies can increase or\\ndecrease our revenue and expenses reported in U.S. dollars or revenue and expenses of our customers and,\\nconsequently, may impact the ability of our customers to satisfy their payment obligations and our results of\\noperations.\\nChanges in economic and/or market conditions may impact our ability to borrow and/or cost of\\nborrowing.\\nThe condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our\\ncommon stock and our ability to obtain financing, if necessary. If our credit rating is ever downgraded, it\\ncould increase borrowing costs under credit facilities and commercial paper programs, as well as increase the\\ncost of renewing or obtaining, or make it more difficult to renew, obtain or issue new debt financing.\\nAn inability to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our\\nbusiness.\\nThere can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain and protect our\\nintellectual property rights will be completely adequate. Our intellectual property rights may fail to provide\\nus with significant competitive advantages, particularly in foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in\\nan intellectual property portfolio or that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights.\\nThe weakening of protection of our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights could also\\nadversely affect our business.\\nWe are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to intellectual property that is\\nnecessary or useful to our business, including from GE following the Transactions. Our success depends in part\\non the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and sufficiently enforce the licensed intellectual property\\nrights we have commercialized. Without protection for the intellectual property rights we license, other\\ncompanies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our\\ncompetitive business position and harm our business products. Also, there can be no assurances that we will be\\nable to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to use intellectual property rights we need in the\\nfuture, and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms. Specifically we are a\\nparty to several agreements with GE which provide for intellectual property rights to use and access. Access\\nand use of intellectual property created solely or collaboratively with GE is an important part of our\\noperations. We would be adversely affected in the event these agreements were terminated without the right to\\ncontinue such access as we might continue to improve current products and services or develop new ones.\\nWe may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its\\nintellectual property rights.\\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our products\\nand services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis.\\nRegardless of the merits, infringement claims may result in significant legal and other costs and may distract\\nmanagement from running our core business. Resolving such claims could increase our costs, including through\\nroyalty payments to acquire licenses, if available, from third parties and through the development of\\nnon-infringing technologies. If a license to resolve a claim were not available, we might not be able to\\ncontinue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition,\\nresults of operations and cash flows.\\nRisk Factors Related to the Worldwide Oil and Natural Gas Industry\\nVolatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and\\nservices.\\nPrices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis. As a result, the volatility in\\noil and natural gas prices can impact our customers\\' activity levels and spending for our products and\\nservices. Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to\\nfund exploration and development activities. Although oil prices have risen over the past year, this increase\\nfollows a decline through most of 2016,\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 17\\n\\n\\nand uncertainty remains about the trajectory of oil prices going forward. Expectations about\\nfuture prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels.\\nLower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers. While\\nhigher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy\\nprices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers.\\nOur customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher\\nreturns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk. Any of these factors could affect the demand\\nfor oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations.\\nDemand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely\\naffect our operating results. Changes in the global economy could impact our customers\\' spending levels and our\\nrevenue and operating results.\\nDemand for oil and natural gas, as well as the demand for our services and products, is highly\\ncorrelated with global economic growth, and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the U.S.,\\nIndia, China, and developing countries in Asia and the Middle East, which are either significant users of oil\\nand natural gas or whose economies are experiencing the most rapid economic growth compared to the global\\naverage. Weakness or deterioration of the global economy or credit markets could reduce our customers\\' spending\\nlevels and reduce our revenue and operating results. Incremental weakness in global economic activity,\\nparticularly in China, India, Europe, the Middle East and developing countries in Asia, could reduce demand for\\noil and natural gas and result in lower oil and natural gas prices. Incremental strength in global economic\\nactivity in such areas will create more demand for oil and natural gas and support higher oil and natural gas\\nprices. A prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices may require us to record additional asset\\nimpairments. Such a potential impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our operating\\nresults.\\nRequirements and voluntary initiatives to reduce emissions, as well as increased climate\\nchange awareness, are likely to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb emissions and\\ncould have an adverse impact on demand for oil and natural gas.\\nInternational, national, and state governments, agencies and bodies continue to evaluate and\\npromulgate regulations and voluntary initiatives that are focused on restricting GHG emissions.  These\\nrequirements and initiatives are likely to become more stringent over time and to result in increased costs for\\nthe oil and gas industry to curb GHG emissions.  In addition, these developments may curtail production and\\ndemand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards and investment in relatively\\nlower carbon energy sources such as wind, solar and other renewables.  The renewable energy industry is\\ndeveloping enhanced technologies and becoming more competitive with fossil-fuel energy. If renewable energy\\nbecomes more competitive than fossil-fuel energy, particularly during periods of higher oil and natural gas\\nprices, it could have a material effect on our results of operations. Please see the section entitled \"Risk\\nFactors Related to Our Business-Compliance with, and rulings and litigation in connection with, environmental\\nregulations and the environmental impacts of our or our customers\\' operations may adversely affect our business\\nand operating results.\"\\nSupply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely\\naffect our operating results.\\nProductive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers\\' decisions to\\ndevelop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and\\nwe operate. The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new\\nwells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells.\\nAdvanced technologies, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, improve total recovery but also\\nresult in a more rapid production decline and may become subject to more stringent regulation, particularly on\\nthe state or local level, in the future.\\nProductive capacity in excess of demand (\"spare productive capacity\") is also an important\\nfactor influencing energy prices and spending by oil and natural gas exploration companies. Spare productive\\ncapacity and oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are an indicator of the relative balance between\\nsupply and demand. High or increasing storage, inventories, or spare productive capacity generally indicate\\nthat supply is exceeding demand and that energy prices are likely to soften. Low or decreasing storage,\\ninventories, or spare productive capacity are generally an indicator that demand is growing faster than supply\\nand that energy prices are likely to rise.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 18\\n\\n\\nAccess to prospects is also important to our customers, but such access may be limited because\\nhost governments do not allow access to the reserves. Government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and\\nnatural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations may also limit the\\nquantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced.\\nSupply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual OPEC nations and other large oil\\nand natural gas producing countries, including, but not limited to, Norway and Russia, are willing and able to\\ncontrol production and exports of oil, to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price\\nwhile meeting their market share objectives. Any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural\\ngas and could have a material effect on our results of operations.\\nOur customers\\' activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay\\namounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to\\naccess equity or credit markets.\\nOur customers\\' access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary\\nto develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices, required\\ninvestments and resulting returns. Limited access to external sources of funding has caused and may continue to\\ncause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow.\\nIn addition, a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing\\nbases under reserve-based credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the\\nability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for doubtful\\naccounts.\\nSeasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and\\noperations.\\nVariation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have\\na significant impact on demand for our services and operations. Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes\\nin the Gulf of Mexico, may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers\\' operations, cause supply\\ndisruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be\\ninsured. For example, extreme winter conditions in Canada, Russia or the North Sea may interrupt or curtail our\\noperations, or our customers\\' operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue.\\nRisk Factors Related to the Transactions\\nWe may experience challenges relating to the ongoing integration of Baker Hughes Incorporated\\nand GE O&G that may result in a decline in the anticipated benefits of the Transactions.\\nThe Transactions involved the combination of two businesses that previously operated as\\nindependent businesses. The Company has been and will continue to be required to devote management attention\\nand resources to integrating its business practices and operations.\\nIf we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the\\nTransactions may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, or be offset by the\\ndecrease in business from certain customers. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on our\\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition or other prospects on an ongoing basis.\\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur transaction-related and restructuring costs in\\nconnection with the Transactions and the integration of the two businesses.\\nWe have incurred transaction-related and restructuring costs in connection with the\\nTransactions and will continue to incur such costs in connection with the integration of the businesses of\\nBaker Hughes Incorporated and GE O&G. There are many systems that must be successfully integrated,\\nincluding information management, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll and benefits,\\nfixed asset and lease administration systems and regulatory compliance. We are still assessing the magnitude of\\nthese costs and, therefore, are not able to provide estimates of these costs.\\nThe costs related to restructuring have been included as a liability in the purchase price\\nallocation or expensed as incurred, depending on the nature of the restructuring activity. Moreover, many of\\nthe expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses\\ncould, particularly in the near term, reduce the cost synergies that we achieve from the elimination of\\nduplicative expenses and the realization of\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 19\\n\\n\\neconomies of scale and cost synergies related to the integration of the businesses following\\nthe completion of the Transactions, and accordingly, any net synergies may not be achieved in the near term or\\nat all. These integration expenses may result in us taking significant charges against earnings following the\\ncompletion of the Transactions.\\nWe are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, qualify\\nfor, and are relying on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, our\\nstockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such\\nrequirements. The interests of GE as a controlling stockholder may differ from the interests of other\\nstockholders of the Company.\\nThrough its ownership of a majority of the Company\\'s voting power and the provisions set forth\\nin the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and the Stockholders Agreement, GE has the ability to designate and\\nelect a majority of the Company\\'s directors. As a result of GE\\'s ownership of a majority of the voting power of\\ncommon stock, the Company is a \"controlled company\" as defined in NYSE listing rules and, therefore, is not\\nsubject to NYSE requirements that would otherwise require the Company to have (i) a majority of independent\\ndirectors, (ii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors, (iii) the compensation of its\\nexecutive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed\\nsolely of independent directors, and (iv) director nominees selected, or recommended for the board\\'s selection,\\neither by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent\\ndirectors. Under the Stockholders Agreement, our Board will generally have four directors not designated by GE\\nand five directors designated by GE.    \\nGE also has control over certain matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including\\nchanges in capital structure, transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law and corporate\\ngovernance, subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement relating to GE\\'s agreement to vote in favor of\\ndirector nominees not designated by GE and to proposals by GE to acquire all of the shares of common stock held\\nby non-GE stockholders. GE may have different interests than other holders of Class A common stock.\\nAmong other things, GE\\'s control could delay, defer, or prevent a sale of the Company that the\\nCompany\\'s other stockholders support, or, conversely, this control could result in the consummation of such a\\ntransaction that other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could discourage a potential\\ninvestor from seeking to acquire Class A common stock and, as a result, might harm the market price of that\\nClass A common stock.\\nGiven GE\\'s ownership of the majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company and\\nthe interactions that have and will take place between the Company and GE through the GE Store and otherwise,\\nthe success of the Company depends in part on the reputation and success of GE.\\nIf we were to cease being a majority-owned subsidiary of GE in the future, such a separation\\ncould adversely affect our business and profitability. Uncertainty about the likelihood of any such separation\\ncould also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAs a subsidiary of GE, we market many of our products and services using the \"GE\" brand name\\nand logo. We believe that the association with GE provides many benefits, including: a strong brand, broad\\nresearch and development capabilities, elevated status with suppliers and customers, and established\\nrelationships with regulators.\\nAlthough GE has licensed to us the right to use certain \"GE\" marks in its corporate name and\\nin the products and services of our business in connection with certain oil and gas activities and other\\ndiscrete oil and gas segments, that right to use these marks would be lost if the license were to expire or\\notherwise terminate.\\nIn addition, if we were to cease being a majority-owned subsidiary of GE, or there were\\notherwise a meaningful change in the relationships between GE and the Company, such an event(s) could adversely\\naffect, among other things, our ability to attract and retain customers. Among other things, we may be required\\nto provide more favorable pricing and other terms to our customers and take other action to maintain our\\nrelationship with existing, and attract new, customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, although GE would be subject to\\ncertain non-compete restrictions for a period of time following the Company no longer being a majority-owned\\nsubsidiary of GE, in the absence of an agreement regulating the go-to-market strategy and the reciprocal\\ncommercial and technical support between GE and the Company, GE may attempt to compete with us with respect to\\ncertain technologies and customer projects where we have adjacent or overlapping presence (e.g., steam turbines\\nand gas turbines).  Furthermore, we may\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 20\\n\\n\\nlose cost synergies, joint investment and R&D opportunities, and access to customers, in\\nfields where we and GE currently collaborate as per the terms of the Channel Agreement (e.g. additive\\nmanufacturing; digital).\\n\\nITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\\nOPERATIONS\\nManagement\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\\nOperations (\"MD&A\") should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\ncontained herein.\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nOn July 3, 2017, we closed the Transactions to combine GE O&G and Baker\\nHughes, creating a fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of integrated oilfield\\nproducts, services and digital solutions. As a result of the Transactions, BHGE became the holding company of\\nthe combined businesses. The Transactions were executed using a partnership structure, pursuant to which GE\\nO&G and Baker Hughes each contributed their operating assets to a newly formed partnership, BHGE LLC. GE\\nholds an approximate 62.5% controlling interest in this partnership and former Baker Hughes stockholders hold\\nan approximate 37.5% interest through the ownership of 100% of our Class A common stock. The results of\\noperations for the Company include the results of Baker Hughes from July 3, 2017, the date of acquisition,\\nthrough December 31, 2017. The majority of the Baker Hughes business operations are included in the Oilfield\\nServices segment. The Transactions were treated as a \"reverse acquisition\" for accounting purposes and, as\\nsuch, the historical financial statements of the accounting acquirer, GE O&G, are the historical financial\\nstatements of the Company. The current year results, and balances, may not be comparable to prior years as the\\ncurrent year includes the results of Baker Hughes from July 3, 2017. We operate through our four business\\nsegments: Oilfield Services (OFS), Oilfield Equipment (OFE), Turbomachinery & Processing Solutions (TPS),\\nand Digital Solutions (DS). As of December 31, 2017, BHGE employs over 64,000\\nemployees and operates in more than 120 countries.\\nIn 2017, we generated revenue of $17,259\\nmillion, compared to $13,269 million in 2016. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by OFS as a result of the acquisition of Baker\\nHughes, and to a lesser extent, by DS partially offset by declines in TPS and OFE. Loss before income taxes and\\nequity in loss of affiliate was $160 million in 2017, and included restructuring and impairment charges\\nof $412 million and merger and related costs of\\n$373 million. These restructuring and impairment charges were\\nrecorded as a result of our continued actions to adjust our operations and cost structure to reflect reduced\\nactivity levels. In 2016, income before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate was $584 million, which also included restructuring and impairment charges of\\n$516 million, and merger and related costs of $33 million.\\nOUTLOOK\\nOur business is exposed to a number of different macro factors, which influence our\\nexpectations and outlook. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today,\\nand are subject to change given volatile conditions in the industry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nNorth America onshore activity: in 2017, we experienced an acceleration in rig count growth,\\nas compared to 2016. We expect the increased activity in North America to continue to grow in 2018, however, at\\na slower pace than seen in 2017. We remain optimistic about the outlook.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nInternational onshore activity: we have seen a moderate increase in rig count activity in\\n2017 and expect growth to continue into 2018, at a moderate rate. We have seen signs of improvement with the\\nincrease in commodity prices, but due to continued volatility, we remain cautious as to growth\\nexpectations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nOffshore projects: although commodity prices increased in 2017, we have yet to see a change\\nin customer spending behavior, as a result of continued oil price volatility. We expect final investment\\ndecisions to continue to remain fluid. We have seen an increase in subsea tree awards in 2017, and expect tree\\nawards to increase in 2018, but still at levels significantly below prior 2012 & 2013 peaks, as customers\\ncontinue to remain cautious with regards to major capital expenditures for the near term.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nLiquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects: we believe the market continues to be oversupplied, and\\nwill remain in its current state for the next few years. We expect some final investment decisions to move\\nforward in\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 26\\n\\n\\nthe short term. We do, however, view the long term economics of the LNG industry as positive\\ngiven our outlook for supply and demand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nRefinery, petrochemical and industrial projects: in refining, we believe large, complex\\nrefineries should gain advantage in a more competitive, oversupplied landscape in 2018 as the industry\\nglobalizes and refiners position to meet local demand and secure export potential. In petrochemicals, we\\ncontinue to see healthy demand and cost-advantaged supply driving projects forward in 2018. The industrial\\nmarket continues to grow as outdated infrastructure is replaced, policy changes come into effect and power is\\ndecentralized. We continue to see growing demand across these markets in 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with different industrial\\nmetrics such as our Digital Solutions business. Overall, we believe our portfolio is uniquely positioned to\\ncompete across the value chain, and deliver unique solutions for our customers. We remain optimistic about the\\nlong-term economics of the industry, but are continuing to operate with flexibility given our expectations for\\nvolatility and changing assumptions in the near term.\\nIn 2016, solar and wind net additions exceeded coal and gas for the first time and it\\ncontinued throughout 2017.  Governments may change or may not continue incentives for renewable energy\\nadditions.  In the long term, renewables\\' cost decline may accelerate to compete with new-built fossil\\ncapacity, however, we do not anticipate any significant impacts to our business in the foreseeable\\nfuture.\\nDespite the near-term volatility, the long-term outlook for our industry remains strong. We\\nbelieve the world\\'s demand for energy will continue to rise, and the supply of energy will continue to increase\\nin complexity, requiring greater service intensity and more advanced technology from oilfield service\\ncompanies. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative cost-efficient solutions that deliver step\\nchanges in operating and economic performance for our customers.\\n\\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors\\naffecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined\\nfinancial statements and related notes of the Company. Amounts reported in millions in graphs within this\\nreport are computed based on the amounts in hundreds. As a result, the sum of the components reported in\\nmillions may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding.\\nWe operate in more than 120 countries helping customers find, evaluate, drill, produce, transport and process hydrocarbon resources.\\nOur revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and\\nindependent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and\\nnatural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors,\\nincluding our customers\\' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and\\nproduce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government\\nregulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their\\ncash flows.\\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing\\nprices during each of the periods indicated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrent oil prices ($/Bbl) (1)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n54.12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n43.64\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n52.32\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWTI oil prices ($/Bbl) (2)\\n\\n\\n50.80\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n43.29\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n48.66\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNatural gas prices ($/mmBtu) (3)\\n\\n\\n2.99\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2.52\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2.62\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) \\n\\n\\nEnergy Information Administration (EIA) Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 27\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(2) \\n\\n\\nEIA Cushing, OK WTI (West Texas Intermediate) spot price\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(3) \\n\\n\\nEIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit\\n\\n\\n\\nOutside North America, customer spending is most heavily influenced by Brent oil prices, which\\nfluctuated significantly throughout the year, ranging from a low of $43.98/Bbl in June 2017 to a high of\\n$68.80/Bbl in December 2017. Oil prices bottomed early in 2016 due to the impending production increases in\\nIran after economic sanctions were lifted. During 2017, OPEC considered production cuts, and in the fourth\\nquarter they announced extensions to agreed-upon production cuts. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017,\\nBrent oil prices shifted meaningfully higher. In addition, demand for oil was higher than expected due to\\nrobust consumption in North America and revisions to Chinese, Russian, and European demand growth\\nexpectations.\\nIn North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices, which, similar to\\nBrent oil prices, fluctuated significantly throughout the year, with the highest prices being recorded towards\\nthe end of the year. Overall, WTI oil prices ranged from a low of $42.48/Bbl in June 2017 to a high of\\n$60.46/Bbl in December 2017.\\nAlthough oil prices have rebounded more than 100% from the previous year\\'s twelve-year low of\\n$26/Bbl reached in February 2016 to near $60/Bbl at the end of 2017, there has yet to be any material change in\\ncustomer behavior, other than in certain U.S. basins, to suggest a near-term broader recovery in activity\\nlevels.\\nIn North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price,\\naveraged $2.99 /mmBtu in 2017, representing a 19% increase over the prior year. Throughout the year, Henry Hub\\nNatural Gas Spot Prices ranged from a high of $3.71 /mmBtu in January 2017 to a low of $2.44 /mmBtu in February\\n2017. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\"), working natural gas in storage at the end of 2017 was\\n3,126 billion cubic feet (\"Bcf\"), which was 5.6%, or 185 Bcf, below the corresponding week in 2016.\\n\\nBaker Hughes Rig Count\\n\\nThe Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and\\nits suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service\\nindustry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas\\ncompanies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The\\ncounts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity, however,\\nthese counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect\\noverall energy prices and market activity.\\nWe have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data\\nthrough our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs,\\ncustomers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either\\noil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then\\ncompiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We\\nbelieve the counting process and resulting data is reliable, however, it is subject to our ability to obtain\\naccurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all\\ninternational rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such\\nas Russia, the Caspian region, Iran and onshore China because this information is not readily available.\\nRigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well\\nbeing drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of\\nsufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a\\nweekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly\\nresults are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are\\nin transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production\\ntesting, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 28\\n\\n\\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods\\nindicated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorth America\\n\\n\\n1,082\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n642\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n1,178\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInternational\\n\\n\\n948\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n956\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n1,168\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorldwide\\n\\n\\n2,030\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n1,598\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2,346\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2017 Compared to 2016\\nOverall the rig count was 2,030 in 2017, an increase of 27% as compared to 2016 due primarily\\nto North American activity. The rig count in North America increased 69% in 2017 compared to 2016.\\nInternationally, the rig count decreased 1% in 2017 as compared to the same period last year.\\nWithin North America, the increase was primarily driven by the land rig count, which was up\\n72%, partially offset by a decrease in the offshore rig count of 16%. Internationally, the rig count decrease\\nwas driven primarily by decreases in Latin America of 7%, the Europe region and Africa region, which were down\\nby 4% and 2%, respectively, partially offset by the Asia-Pacific region, which was up 8%.\\n2016 Compared to 2015\\nOverall the rig count was 1,598 in 2016, a decrease of 32% as compared to\\n2015 due primarily to North American activity.

Services backlog increased by 5% to $15,223 million. Backlog\\nremains strong and provides an indication of long-term revenue within the Company.\\n\\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated and combined\\nstatements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant\\nchanges or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified\\nspecific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have\\nquantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on\\na total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in\\ntabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may\\nnot add due to the use of rounded numbers.\\nThe results of operations for the Company include the results of Baker Hughes from July 3,\\n2017, the date of acquisition, through the end of the year ended December 31, 2017. Our results of operations\\nare evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer on a combined and consolidated basis as well as at the segment\\nlevel.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 30\\n\\n\\nThe performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income\\n(loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate and before the\\nfollowing: net interest expense, net other non operating income (loss), corporate expenses, restructuring,\\nimpairment and other charges, inventory impairment, merger and related costs, goodwill impairment and certain\\ngains and losses not allocated to the operating segments.\\nIn evaluating the segment performance, the Company uses the following:\\nVolume & Price: Volume is the increase or\\ndecrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange and\\nprice. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in\\nrevenue volume between the current and prior period. Price is defined as the change in sales price for a\\ncomparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales\\nprices of comparable products and services.\\nForeign Exchange (FX): FX measures the\\ntranslational foreign exchange impact, or the translation impact of the period-over-period change on sales and\\ncosts directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the US dollar. FX impact is\\ncalculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts (revenue or profit) with the period-over-period FX\\nrate variance, using the average exchange rate for the respective period.\\n(Inflation)/Deflation: (Inflation)/deflation is\\ndefined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of\\nvolume. It is calculated as the year-over-year change in cost (i.e. price paid) of direct material,\\ncompensation & benefits and overhead costs.\\nProductivity: Productivity is measured by the\\nremaining variance in profit, after adjusting for the period-over-period impact of volume & price, foreign\\nexchange and (inflation)/deflation as defined above. Improved or lower period-over-period cost productivity is\\nthe result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies, such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume, or\\ncost increasing or decreasing less than volume, or changes in sales mix among segments. This also includes the\\nperiod-over-period variance of transactional foreign exchange, aside from those foreign currency devaluations\\nthat are reported separately for business evaluation purposes.\\nRevenue and Segment Operating Income (Loss) Before Tax\\nRevenue and segment operating income (loss) for each of our four operating segments is\\nprovided

We believe that cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and the available credit\\nfacility will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs.\\nCash Flows\\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended\\nDecember 31:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(In millions)\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOperating activities\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(799\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n262\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n1,277\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInvesting activities\\n\\n\\n(4,130\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(472\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(466\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinancing activities\\n\\n\\n10,919\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(102\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(515\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOperating Activities\\n\\nOur largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest\\ncomponent is collecting cash related to product or services sales including advance payments or progress\\ncollections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax\\nauthorities and others for a wide range of material and services.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 36\\n\\n\\nCash flows from operating activities used cash of $799 million and generated cash of $262 million\\nfor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash flows from operating\\nactivities decreased $1,061 million in 2017 primarily driven\\nby a $1,201 million negative impact from ending our receivables monetization program in the fourth quarter, and\\nrestructuring related payments throughout the year. These cash outflows were partially offset by strong working\\ncapital cash flows, especially in the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in our cash flows from operating\\nactivities for 2017 and 2016 are payments of $612 million and $177 million, respectively, made for employee\\nseverance and contract termination costs as a result of our restructuring activities initiated during the\\nyear.\\nCash flows from operating activities generated $262 million and $1,277 million for the years\\nended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $1,015 million\\nin 2016 primarily due to the decrease in net income, partially offset by improvements in other working capital\\ncategories, due to improvements in the collection of past due receivables, improved inventory management and\\nrestructuring.\\nInvesting Activities\\nCash flows from investing activities used cash of $4,130 million, $472 million and $466\\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital\\nexpenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to\\ngenerate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $665\\nmillion, $424 million and\\n$607 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property,\\nplant and equipment of $172 million, $20 million and $30 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Proceeds\\nfrom the disposal of assets related primarily to equipment that was lost-in-hole, and to property, machinery\\nand equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period.\\nIn 2017, cash flows from investing activities also includes $7,498 million of special dividend\\npaid to former Baker Hughes stockholders on the acquisition of Baker Hughes, net of $4,133 million of cash\\nreceived from the acquisition. There were no material business dispositions in 2017.\\nThere were no material acquisitions or dispositions in 2016, however, in 2015, we generated\\ncash of approximately $181 million from business dispositions and utilized cash of $86 million for business\\nacquisitions.\\nFinancing Activities\\nCash flows from financing activities generated cash of $10,919 million; and used cash of $102\\nmillion and $515 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\\nIn 2017, our primary source of financing cash flows was a contribution of $7,400 million from\\nGE to fund substantially all of the special dividend paid to former Baker Hughes stockholders. We also\\ngenerated financing cash flows of $3,950 million from debt issued through a private placement offering on\\nDecember 11, 2017. We incurred issuance costs of $26 million related to this debt issuance.\\nWe had net repayments of short-term debt of $663\\nmillion and $156 million in\\n2017 and 2016,\\nrespectively, and net borrowings of $177 million in\\n2015.\\nIn December 2017, we purchased $176 million of the aggregate outstanding principal amount\\nassociated with our long-term outstanding notes and debentures. Pursuant to a cash tender offer, the purchases\\nresulted in the payment of an early-tender premium, including various fees of $28 million.\\nAdditionally, in 2017, we paid aggregate dividends of $155 million to our Class A\\nstockholders, and BHGE LLC made a distribution of $251 million to GE. As part of our $3 billion share buyback\\nauthorization, we used cash of $174 million and $303 million, respectively, to repurchase and cancel our Class\\nA and Class B common shares and corresponding paired common units in BHGE LLC, on a pro rata basis. The\\nrepurchase did not result in a change of GE\\'s approximate 62.5% interest in BHGE LLC.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 37\\n\\n\\nCash flows from financing activities in 2017 also included net transfers\\nfrom GE of $1,498 million primarily driven by the cash\\npooling activity with GE prior to the Transactions. Other financing items during the year included a payment of\\n$193 million to complete the purchase of the non-controlling interest in the Pipeline Inspection and Integrity\\nbusiness within Digital Solutions.\\nAvailable Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program\\nOn July 3, 2017, in connection with the Transactions, we entered into a\\nnew five-year $3 billion\\ncommitted unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2017 Credit Agreement) with commercial\\nbanks maturing in July 2022. The 2017 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and\\nwarranties, certain affirmative covenants and no negative covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events of\\ndefault, our obligations under the 2017 Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include\\npayment defaults to lenders under the 2017 Credit Agreement, and other customary defaults. We were in\\ncompliance with all of the credit facility\\'s covenants, and in 2017 there were no borrowings under the credit\\nfacility.\\nOn November 3, 2017, BHGE LLC entered into a commercial paper program under\\nwhich it may issue from time to time up to $3 billion in\\ncommercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days. At December 31, 2017\\nwe had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program. The maximum combined\\nborrowing at any time under both the 2017 Credit Agreement and the commercial paper program is\\n$3 billion. \\nIf market conditions were to change and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating\\ncosts were to increase, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, it could cause the rating\\nagencies to lower our credit rating. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any\\nborrowings under our committed credit facility. However, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the\\ncost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial\\npaper. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit\\nfacility.\\nCash Requirements\\nIn 2018, we believe cash\\non hand, cash flows from operating activities, the available debt shelf registration, and the 2017 Credit\\nAgreement will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs,\\nmeet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and dividends, and support the development of our\\nshort-term and long-term operating strategies. If necessary, we may issue commercial paper or other short-term\\ndebt to fund cash needs in the U.S. in excess of the cash generated in the U.S.\\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market\\ndemand and activity levels. In light of the current market conditions, capital expenditures in 2018 will be\\nmade as appropriate at a rate that we estimate would equal up to 5% of annual revenue. The expenditures are\\nexpected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate\\nmaking income tax payments in the range of $325 million to $375 million in 2018.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 38\\n\\n\\nContractual Obligations\\nIn the table below, we set forth our contractual obligations as of\\nDecember 31, 2017. Certain amounts included in this table are based\\non our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by\\nthird parties and other factors. The contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary\\nfrom those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nPayments Due by Period\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(In millions)\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nLess Than\\n1 Year\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n1 - 3\\nYears\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n4 - 5\\nYears\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nMore Than\\n5 Years\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal debt and capital lease obligations (1)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n8,081\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n2,013\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n56\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n1,729\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n4,283\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEstimated interest payments (2)\\n\\n\\n4,018\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n274\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n481\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n461\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2,802\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOperating leases (3)\\n\\n\\n688\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n156\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n214\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n130\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n188\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPurchase obligations (4)\\n\\n\\n1,121\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n962\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n87\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n59\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n13,908\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n3,405\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n838\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n2,379\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n7,286\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) \\n\\n\\nAmounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts\\nrelated to our debt, including capital lease obligations. Amounts for debt do not include any deferred issuance\\ncosts or unamortized discounts or premiums including step up in the value of the debt on the acquisition of\\nBaker Hughes. Expected cash payments for interest are excluded from these amounts. Total debt and capital lease\\nobligations includes $1,124 million payable to GE and its\\naffiliates. As there is no fixed payment schedule on the amount payable to GE and its affiliates we have\\nclassified it as payable in less than one year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(2) \\n\\n\\nAmounts represent the expected cash payments for interest on our long-term debt and capital\\nlease obligations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(3) \\n\\n\\nAmounts represent the future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases with\\ninitial or remaining terms of one year or more. We enter into operating leases, some of which include renewal\\noptions, however, we have excluded renewal options from the table above unless it is anticipated that we will\\nexercise such renewals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(4) \\n\\n\\nPurchase obligations include capital improvements for 2018 as well as agreements to purchase\\ngoods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including:\\nfixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate\\ntiming of the transaction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDue to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash\\noutflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period\\nof cash settlement, if any, to the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $543\\nmillion in uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, have been\\nexcluded from the contractual obligations table above. See \"Note 10. Income Taxes\" of the Notes to Consolidated\\nand Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\\nWe have certain defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit\\nplans covering certain of our U.S. and international employees. During 2017, we made contributions and paid\\ndirect benefits of approximately $63 million in connection\\nwith those plans, and we anticipate funding approximately $68 million\\nduring 2018. Amounts for pension funding obligations are based on assumptions that are\\nsubject to change, therefore, we are currently not able to reasonably estimate our contribution figures after\\n2018. See \"Note 9. Employee Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in\\nItem 8 herein for further information.\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have\\nentered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other\\nbank issued guarantees, which totaled approximately $3.4 billion at December 31,\\n2017. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments.\\nNone of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our\\nconsolidated and combined financial statements.\\nAs of December 31, 2017,\\nwe had no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than normal operating leases, as discussed\\nabove. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could\\narise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 39\\n\\n\\nOther factors affecting liquidity\\nCustomer receivables: In\\nline with industry practice, we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon\\ncontractual terms. In a challenging economic environment, we may experience delays in the payment of our\\ninvoices due to customers\\' lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets.\\nWhile historically there have not been material non-payment events, we attempt to mitigate this risk through\\nworking with our customers to restructure their debts. A customer\\'s failure or delay in payment could have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on our short-term liquidity and results from operations. As of December 31, 2017, 20%\\nof our gross trade receivables were from customers in the United States. Other than the United States, no other\\ncountry or single customer accounted for more than 10% of our gross trade receivables at this date. As of\\nDecember 31, 2016, 13% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the United States.\\nVenezuela: Oil production is considered important\\nto the Venezuelan economy; therefore, we intend to continue to provide services to our primary customer in this\\ncountry, however, we are required to assess the ability of the customer to make timely payments on amounts owed\\nto us. This assessment is performed on a quarterly basis with the business relying on a variety of data sources\\nto assess the collectability of outstanding receivables and recoverability of other assets supporting this\\ncustomer. We noted that there are recent market indicators, such as a decline in bond prices and several\\ndelayed payments on various bond obligations, that indicate that the customer\\'s financial condition may have\\nworsened in the last three months. We continue to actively manage our relationship with this customer as they\\ntransition through a difficult period, with ongoing dialogue between key executives of both companies,\\nincluding discussions regarding this customer\\'s ability and intent to ultimately settle our trade\\nreceivables.\\n\\nIn performing our analysis of customer-specific assets as of December 31, 2017, we considered\\nthat our outstanding receivables do not have the same priority as certain of the customer\\'s other obligations.\\nWe have concluded that it may take an extended period of time to ultimately collect our outstanding\\nreceivables; accordingly, we have recorded an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts of $55 million in\\nthe three months ended December 31, 2017 to fully offset our remaining exposure to trade receivables and other\\nassets from this customer. In addition, since future receivables generated as a result of our ongoing contracts\\nwill have the same priority as our existing receivables when issued, the business has concluded that an\\nallowance amounting to $32 million to reduce inventory that has been purchased for these contracts (and that is\\nnot redeployable to fulfill other customer contracts) to its lower of cost or net realizable value is\\nwarranted. We will update our analysis on a quarterly basis; to the extent that our outstanding receivables are\\nsettled or the likelihood of settling our outstanding receivables in the near term improves, we will reverse\\nour existing provision for doubtful accounts, which would result in an income during the period of\\nreversal.\\nInternational operations: Our cash that is held outside the U.S., is 46% of the total cash balance as of December 31, 2017. We may\\nnot be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it\\nchallenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this\\ncash.\\n\\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\\nAccounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those considered to be the\\nmost critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and\\nuncertainties. Many of these estimates include determining fair value. These estimates reflect our best\\njudgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their potential\\neffects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change\\nfrom those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change,\\nwhich may result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles and longlived assets, increases in reserves for\\ncontingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities,\\namong other effects. Also, see \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to\\nConsolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant\\naccounting policies.\\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal\\nof either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or\\ncomplex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors\\nhas reviewed our critical\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 40\\n\\n\\naccounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years,\\nwe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates,\\nand we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our\\nconsolidated and combined financial statements. There are other items within our consolidated and combined\\nfinancial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined\\nabove.\\nRevenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements\\n\\nWe have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our TPS segment.\\nThese agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term.\\nThese agreements have average contract terms of 15 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be\\nextended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost\\nestimates.\\n\\nWe recognize revenue as we incur costs to perform under the arrangements at the estimated\\nmargin rate of the contract. Revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of\\nboth customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term.\\n\\nTo develop our billings estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur\\nbased on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated\\nutilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product\\nintroductions, if applicable.\\n\\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul\\nevents, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the\\nservices. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and\\nexpected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have\\nbeen observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval\\nprocess.\\n\\nWe routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly\\nrevise them to adjust for changes. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is\\navailable at the time of the review. \\n\\nThe difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash\\nreceived from our customers results in either a contract asset (revenue in excess of billings) or a contract\\nliability (billings in excess of revenue). As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, we recorded a contract asset\\nof $1,410 million and $1,046\\nmillion and contract liability of $83 million and $103 million,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nWe regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and\\ncontract assets and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to\\noffset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into expected future\\nutilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the\\nclose interaction with our customers through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods.\\nRevisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement\\'s total estimated profitability\\nresulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments generated earnings of $344 million, $293 million and\\n$256 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We provide for\\nprobable losses when they become evident.\\nWe continue to evaluate the provisions of ASC No. 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\\nand the assessment of the impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements and related disclosures.\\nAlso, see \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined\\nFinancial Statements in Item 8 herein for additional information and disclosure.\\nGoodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets\\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually using data as of July 1 of that year. The impairment\\ntest consists of two different steps: in step one, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with\\nits fair value, in step two, which is applied only when the carrying value is more than its fair value, the\\namount of goodwill impairment, if any, is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit\\'s assets\\nand liabilities from the fair value of its equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of\\ngoodwill. We determine fair values of each of the reporting units\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 41\\n\\n\\nusing the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a\\ncombination of both. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data\\nat the time the valuation is performed.\\nPension Assumptions\\nPension benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure\\npension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two assumptions, discount rate and expected\\nreturn on assets, are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these\\ncritical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We periodically evaluate other\\nassumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to\\nreflect its experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from\\nactuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.\\nProjected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected\\npayments discounted using the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income\\nsecurities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits, lower discount rates increase present\\nvalues and subsequent year pension expense and higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent\\nyear pension expense. The discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations for our principal pension\\nplans at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 2.99%,\\n3.41% and 3.83%, respectively, reflecting market interest rates. Our\\nexpected return on assets at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 6.26%, 6.86% and\\n6.91%, respectively.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe operate in more than 120 countries and our effective tax rate is based on our income,\\nstatutory tax rates and differences between tax laws and the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\\n(GAAP) in these various jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the\\ntaxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the\\ntax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate depends on\\nthe extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon\\nrepatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings\\nwill generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.\\nIndefinite reinvestment is determined by management\\'s judgment about and intentions concerning the future\\noperations of the Company. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations.\\nAt December 31, 2017, we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision as a result of U.S. tax reform\\nbut will reassess this during the course of 2018. At December 31, 2017, approximately $8.0 billion of earnings\\nhave been indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. These additional foreign earnings could become subject to\\nadditional tax, if remitted, or deemed remitted, as a dividend. Computation of the potential deferred tax\\nliability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not\\npracticable.\\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in\\nfuture years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the\\nadequacy of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences,\\nforecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on\\nestimates. We use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight. We\\nrecord a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax\\nassets will not be realized.\\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform) that lowers\\nthe statutory tax rate on U.S. earnings, taxes historic foreign earnings previously deferred from U.S. taxation\\nat a reduced rate of tax (transition tax), establishes a territorial tax system and enacts new taxes associated\\nwith global operations.\\nThe impact of U.S. tax reform has been recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation\\nprovides for additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on several provisions,\\nincluding the computation of the transition tax. Guidance in 2018 could impact the information required for and\\nthe calculation of the transition tax charge and could affect decisions that affect the tax on various U.S. and\\nforeign items which would further impact the final amounts included in the transition tax charge and impact the\\nrevaluation of deferred taxes. In addition,\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 42\\n\\n\\nanalysis performed and conclusions reached as part of the tax return filing process and\\nadditional guidance on accounting for tax reform could affect the provisional amount.\\nAdditionally, as part of U.S. tax reform, the U.S. has enacted a tax on \"base eroding\"\\npayments from the U.S. and a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low-taxed income). Because\\naspects of the new minimum tax and the effect on our operations is uncertain and because aspects of the\\naccounting rules associated with this provision have not been resolved, we have not made a provisional accrual\\nfor the deferred tax aspects of this provision and consequently have not made an accounting policy election on\\nthe deferred tax treatment of this tax.\\nOur tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions\\nwhere we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with\\nthe tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result\\nfrom these proceedings, but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate. We have $395\\nmillion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at December 31, 2017. We are not\\nable to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled.\\nOther Loss Contingencies\\nOther loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary\\ncourse of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future\\nloss. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory\\nproceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments.\\nThe preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements requires us to make\\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and\\nrelated disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates\\nand judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable\\nunder the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to\\nuncertainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired,\\nas additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\\nThe determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers\\nrequires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers\\' ability to pay amounts due us in order to\\ndetermine the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. We monitor our customers\\' payment\\nhistory and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider\\nthe overall business climate in which our customers operate. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded\\nbased on the aging status of the customer accounts or when it becomes evident that the customer will not make\\nthe required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. At December\\n31, 2017 and 2016, the allowance for\\ndoubtful accounts totaled $330 million and\\n$186 million of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We\\nbelieve that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current\\nconditions, however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either\\nadverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that\\nmay be required.\\nInventory Reserves\\nInventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the\\nlower of cost or net realizable value. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess,\\nslow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory\\nquantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production\\nrequirements and technological developments. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and\\nrequire us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes. At December 31,\\n2017 and 2016, inventory reserves\\ntotaled $360 million and $260\\nmillion of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to\\nproperly value potential excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or\\nunanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional\\nprovisions for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 43\\n\\n\\nAcquisitions-Purchase Price Allocation\\nWe allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and\\nliabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the\\nassets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair\\nvalues, including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired assets and widely accepted valuation\\ntechniques such as discounted cash flows. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist in fair value\\ndetermination of inventories, identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities\\nwhen appropriate. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets\\nacquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of\\noperations.\\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED\\nSee \"Note 1.

Under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, enacted in 2012, we are\\nrequired to disclose in our periodic reports if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in business\\nactivities relating to Iran, even if those activities are conducted in accordance with authorizations\\nsubsequently issued by the U.S. Government. Reportable activities include investments that significantly\\nenhance Iran\\'s ability to develop petroleum resources valued at $20 million or more in the aggregate during a\\ntwelve-month period. Reporting is also required for transactions related to Iran\\'s domestic production of\\nrefined petroleum products or Iran\\'s ability to import refined petroleum products valued at $5 million or more\\nin the aggregate during a twelve-month period.\\nIn January 2016, the U.S. Department of Treasury\\'s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\\nissued General License H authorizing U.S.-owned or controlled foreign entities to engage in transactions with\\nIran if these entities meet the requirements of the general license. Pursuant to this authorization, a non-U.S.\\nBHGE affiliate received seven purchase orders during the fourth quarter of 2017 for the sale of goods pursuant\\nto General License H that could potentially enhance Iran\\'s ability to develop petroleum resources. The purchase\\norders cover the sale of valves and parts for industrial machinery and equipment used in gas plants,\\npetrochemical plants and gas production projects in Iran. These purchase orders are valued at less than €0.1\\nmillion ($0.1 million), less than €0.1 million ($0.1 million), less than €0.1 million ($0.1 million), €0.3\\nmillion ($0.3 million), €0.7 million ($0.8 million), €0.1 million ($0.1 million) and €0.8 million ($1 .0\\nmillion). This non-US affiliate also received a cancellation of a previously reported contract for the sale of\\nspare parts for gas turbines. This purchase order cancellation reduces previously reported contract values by\\n€12.3 million ($12.9 million). This non-U.S. affiliate attributed €6.8 million ($8.2 million) in gross revenue\\nand €1.4 million ($1.7 million) in net profits against previously reported transactions during the quarter\\nending December 31, 2017.\\nA second non-U.S. BHGE affiliate received three purchase orders during the fourth quarter of\\n2017 for the sale of spares parts to support the development of offshore petroleum resources. The three\\npurchase orders are individually valued at less than €0.1 million ($0.1 million), less than €0.1 million ($0.1\\nmillion), and less than €0.1 million ($0.1 million) each. This non-U.S. affiliate did not recognize any revenue\\nor profit during the quarter ending December 31, 2017.\\nA third non-U.S. BHGE affiliate received a purchase order pursuant to General License H valued\\nat €0.2 million ($0.2 million) during the fourth quarter of 2017. The non-U.S. affiliate also received a\\npurchase order at the very end of the third quarter valued at €0.3 million ($0.3 million).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nWe are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments and\\narise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into derivative\\nfinancial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk but do not enter into derivative financial\\ninstrument transactions for speculative purposes. A discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial\\ninstruments is presented below.\\nINTEREST RATE RISK\\nThe majority of our debt is comprised of fixed rate instruments. We are\\nsubject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment portfolio. We may use interest rate swaps to manage\\nthe economic effect of fixed rate obligations associated with certain debt.

Many of our significant\\nforeign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency. As such, future earnings\\nare subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated\\nin currencies other than our functional currencies.\\nAdditionally, we buy, manufacture and sell components and products across global markets.\\nThese activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates\\nwhich can adversely affect revenue earned and costs of our operating businesses. When the currency in which\\nequipment is sold differs from the primary currency of the legal entity and the exchange rate fluctuates, it\\nwill affect the revenue earned on the sale. These sales and purchase transactions also create receivables and\\npayables denominated in foreign currencies and exposure to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes\\nin exchange rates. Changes in the price of raw materials used in manufacturing can affect the cost of\\nmanufacturing. We use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate these exposures, where appropriate.\\nWe use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of\\nforeign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts. Accordingly, most derivative activity in\\nthis category consists of currency exchange contracts. We had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts\\nwith net notional amounts aggregating $3.3 billion and\\n$0.6 billion to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various\\nforeign currencies at December 31, 2017 and 2016,\\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2017, the Company estimates that a 1% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S.\\ndollar would result in an impact of approximately $10 million to our pre-tax earnings, however, the Company is\\ngenerally able to mitigate its foreign exchange exposure, where there are liquid financial markets, through use\\nof foreign currency derivative transactions. Also, see \"Note 14. Financial Instruments\" of the Notes to\\nConsolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which has additional details on our\\nstrategy.\\n\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 46\\n\\n\\n\\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\\n\\nManagement\\'s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over\\nour financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management,\\nincluding our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our\\ninternal control over financial reporting based on the 2013 framework in Internal\\nControl - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\\nthe Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, our principal executive officer and principal financial\\nofficer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017. This conclusion is based on the recognition that there are\\ninherent limitations in all systems of internal control. Because of the inherent limitations of internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of\\ncontrols, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls\\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\\nprocedures may deteriorate.\\nKPMG LLP, the Company\\'s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an\\nattestation report on the effectiveness of the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n/s/ LORENZO SIMONELLI\\nLorenzo Simonelli\\nChairman, President and\\nChief Executive Officer\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n/s/ BRIAN WORRELL\\nBrian Worrell\\nChief Financial Officer\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n/s/ KURT CAMILLERI\\nKurt Camilleri\\nVice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHouston, Texas\\nFebruary 23, 2018\\n\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 47\\n\\n\\n\\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\\n\\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company:\\nOpinion on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated and combined statement of financial position of\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2017, the related consolidated\\nand combined statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for\\nthe year ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively, the \"consolidated and combined financial\\nstatements\").

A company\\'s\\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\'s assets that\\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not\\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\\nsubject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree

| 55\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company (the Company, BHGE, we, us, or our), was formed\\non October 28, 2016, for the purpose of facilitating the combination of Baker Hughes and GE O&G. BHGE is a\\nworld-leading, fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of equipment and service\\ncapabilities. We conduct business in more than 120 countries\\nand employ over 64,000 employees.\\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\\nOn July 3, 2017, we closed our previously announced business combination\\n(the Transactions) to combine GE O&G and Baker Hughes (refer to \"Note 2. Business Acquisition\" for further\\ndetails on the Transactions). As a result of the Transactions, the Company became the holding company of the\\ncombined businesses of Baker Hughes and GE O&G. Substantially all of the business of GE O&G and of\\nBaker Hughes were transferred to a subsidiary of the Company, Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC (BHGE LLC),\\non July 3, 2017. GE has approximately 62.5% of economic interest in BHGE LLC and the Company has approximately\\n37.5% of the remaining economic interest in BHGE LLC, held\\nindirectly through two wholly owned subsidiaries. One of these wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company is the\\nsole managing member of BHGE LLC. Although we hold a minority economic interest in BHGE LLC, we conduct and\\nexercise full control over all activities of BHGE LLC, without the approval of any other member, through this\\nwholly owned subsidiary. Accordingly, we consolidate the financial results of BHGE LLC and report a\\nnoncontrolling interest in our consolidated and combined financial statements for the economic interest in BHGE\\nLLC not held by us. We consider BHGE LLC to be a consolidated variable interest entity (VIE). We are a holding\\ncompany and have no material assets other than our ownership interest in BHGE LLC and certain intercompany and\\ntax related balances. BHGE LLC is a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Registrant with separate filing\\nrequirements with the SEC and its separate financial information can be obtained from www.sec.gov. The current\\nyear results, and balances, may not be comparable to prior years as the current year includes the results of\\nBaker Hughes from July 3, 2017.\\nThe accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements of the Company have been\\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. and\\nsuch principles, U.S. GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for annual financial\\ninformation. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\\nThe Company\\'s financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis, effective July\\n3, 2017. Under this basis of presentation, our financial statements consolidate all of our subsidiaries\\n(entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting\\ninterest). All subsequent periods will also be presented on a consolidated basis. For all periods prior to July\\n3, 2017, the Company\\'s financial statements were prepared on a combined basis. The combined financial\\nstatements combine certain accounts of GE and its subsidiaries that were historically managed as part of its\\noil & gas business and contributed to BHGE LLC as part of the Transactions. Additionally, it also includes\\ncertain assets, liabilities and results of operations of other businesses of GE that were also contributed to\\nBHGE LLC as part of the Transactions on a fully retrospective basis (in accordance with the guidance applicable\\nto transactions between entities under common control) based on their carrying values, as reflected in the\\naccounting records of GE. The consolidated and combined statements of income reflect intercompany expense\\nallocations made to us by GE for certain corporate functions and for shared services provided by GE. Where\\npossible, these allocations were made on a specific identification basis, and in other cases, these expenses\\nwere allocated by GE based on relative percentages of net operating costs or some other basis depending on the\\nnature of the allocated cost. See \"Note 16. Related Party Transactions\" for further information on expenses\\nallocated by GE. The historical financial results in the consolidated and combined financial statements\\npresented may not be indicative of the results that would have been achieved had GE O&G operated as a\\nseparate, stand-alone entity during those periods.\\nThe GE O&G numbers in the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss) have been\\nreclassed to conform to the current presentation. We believe that the current presentation is a more\\nappropriate presentation of the combined businesses. Merger and related costs includes all costs associated\\nwith the Transactions described in Note 2. Refer to \"Note 2. Business Acquisition\" for further details.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 56\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements, all dollar and share\\namounts in tabulations are in millions of dollars and shares, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Certain\\ncolumns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.\\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to\\nmake estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any\\ncontingent assets or liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue\\nand expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on\\nvarious other assumptions and information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates\\nand assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty, and accordingly,\\nthese estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is\\nobtained and as our operating environment changes. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in\\nthe preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements are appropriate, actual results could\\ndiffer from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but are not limited to, determining the following:\\nallowance for doubtful accounts and inventory valuation reserves; recoverability of long-lived assets,\\nincluding revenue recognition on long term contracts, valuation of goodwill; useful lives used in depreciation\\nand amortization; income taxes and related valuation allowances; accruals for contingencies; actuarial\\nassumptions to determine costs and liabilities related to employee benefit plans; stock-based compensation\\nexpense; valuation of derivatives and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in\\nacquisitions; and expense allocations for certain corporate functions and shared services provided by GE.\\nForeign Currency\\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations with a functional currency other than the U.S.\\ndollar have been translated into U.S. dollars at the quarterly exchange rates, and revenue, expenses, and cash\\nflows have been translated at average rates for the respective periods. Any resulting translation gains and\\nlosses are included in other comprehensive income (loss).\\nGains and losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the\\nsettlement of receivables or payables in the non-functional currency and those resulting from remeasurements of\\nmonetary items, are included in the consolidated and combined statement of income (loss).\\nCost and Equity Method Investment\\nInvestments in privately held companies in which we do not have the ability\\nto exercise significant influence, most often because we hold a voting interest of 0% to 20% are accounted for\\nusing the cost method.\\nAssociated companies are entities in which we do not have a controlling\\nfinancial interest, but over which we have significant influence, most often because we hold a voting interest\\nof 20% to 50%. Associated companies are accounted for as equity method investments. Results of associated companies\\nare presented on a one-line basis in the caption \"Equity in loss of affiliate\" in our consolidated and combined\\nstatements of income (loss). Investments in, and advances to, associated companies are presented on a one-line\\nbasis in the caption \"All other assets\" in our consolidated and combined statement of financial\\nposition.\\nSales of Goods and Services\\nWe record all sales of goods and services only when a firm sales agreement is in place,\\ndelivery has occurred or services have been rendered and collectability of the fixed or determinable sales\\nprice is reasonably assured.\\nExcept for goods sold under long-term construction type contracts and\\nservice agreements, we recognize sales of goods under the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB)\\n104, Revenue Recognition. In situations where arrangements\\ninclude customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 57\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncriteria, we recognize revenue when we have reliably demonstrated that all specified\\nacceptance criteria have been met or when formal acceptance occurs, respectively. We do not provide for\\nanticipated losses before we record sales.\\nWe recognize revenue on larger construction and equipment contracts using long-term\\nconstruction accounting. We estimate total long-term contract revenue net of price concessions as well as total\\ncontract costs. For larger construction and equipment contracts, we recognize sales based on our progress\\ntoward contract completion measured by actual costs incurred in relation to our estimate of total expected\\ncosts. We routinely update our estimates of future costs for agreements in process and report any cumulative\\neffects of such adjustments in current operations. We provide for any loss that we expect to incur on these\\nagreements when that loss is probable.\\nWe sell product services under long-term product maintenance agreements, where costs of\\nperforming services are incurred on an other than straight-line basis. We recognize related sales based on the\\nextent of our progress toward completion measured by actual costs incurred in relation to our estimate of total\\nexpected costs. We routinely update our estimates of future costs for agreements in process and report any\\ncumulative effects of such adjustments in current operations.\\nFor our long-term product maintenance agreements, we regularly assess customer credit risk\\ninherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract costs and estimated earnings, including the risk\\nthat contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated costs in the event of customer\\ntermination. We gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through\\nour knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customers that comes with\\nsupplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions, after applying the cumulative catch up\\nbasis of accounting, may affect a product services agreement\\'s total estimated profitability resulting in an\\nadjustment of earnings. We provide for probable losses when they become evident.\\nArrangements for the sale of goods and services sometimes include multiple components. Our\\narrangements with multiple components usually involve an upfront deliverable of equipment and future service\\ndeliverables such as installation, commissioning, training or the future delivery of ancillary products. In\\nmost cases, the relative values of the undelivered components are not significant to the overall arrangement\\nand are typically delivered within three to six months after the core product has been delivered. In such\\nagreements, selling price is determined for each component and any difference between the total of the separate\\nselling prices and total contract consideration (i.e., discount) is allocated pro rata across each of the\\ncomponents in the arrangement. The value assigned to each component is objectively determined and obtained\\nprimarily from sources such as the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from competitor prices\\nfor similar items. If such evidence is not available, we use our best estimate of selling price, which is\\nestablished consistent with the pricing strategy of the business and considers product configuration,\\ngeography, customer type, and other market specific factors.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and relate to the\\nresearch and development of new products and services. These costs amounted to $501\\nmillion, $352 million and\\n$408 million for the years ended December\\n31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Research and development expenses were reported\\nin cost of goods sold and cost of services sold.\\nCash and Equivalents\\nShort-term investments with original maturities of three months or less are included in cash\\nequivalents unless designated as available-for-sale and classified as investment securities.\\nAs of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $1,190 million and\\n$752 million, respectively, of cash and equivalents were considered\\nrestricted as they were held in bank accounts and cannot be released, transferred or otherwise converted into a\\ncurrency that is regularly transacted internationally, due to lack of market liquidity, capital controls or\\nsimilar monetary or exchange limitations limiting the flow of capital out of the jurisdiction. Cash and\\nequivalents includes $997 million of cash at\\nDecember 31, 2017 held on behalf of GE, of which $764 million is\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 58\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrestricted, and a corresponding liability is reported in short-term borrowings. See \"Note 16.\\nRelated Party Transactions\" for further details.\\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\\nWe establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on various factors including the payment\\nhistory and financial condition of our debtors and the economic environment. Provisions for doubtful accounts\\nare recorded based on the aging status of the debtor accounts or when it becomes evident that the debtor will\\nnot make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future.\\nConcentration of Credit Risk\\nWe grant credit to our customers who primarily operate in the oil and natural gas industry.\\nAlthough this concentration affects our overall exposure to credit risk, our current receivables are spread\\nover a diverse group of customers across many countries, which mitigates this risk. We perform periodic credit\\nevaluations of our customers\\' financial conditions, including monitoring our customers\\' payment history and\\ncurrent credit worthiness to manage this risk. We do not generally require collateral in support of our current\\nreceivables, but we may require payment in advance or security in the form of a letter of credit or a bank\\nguarantee.\\nInventories\\nAll inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable values and they are measured\\non a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis or average cost basis. As necessary, we record provisions and maintain\\nreserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly\\nreview inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions,\\nproduction requirements and technological developments.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment (PP&E)\\nProperty, plant and equipment is initially stated at cost and is depreciated over its\\nestimated economic life. Subsequently, property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated\\ndepreciation and impairment losses. We manufacture a substantial portion of our tools and equipment and the\\ncost of these items, which includes direct and indirect manufacturing costs, is capitalized and carried in\\ninventory until it is completed.\\nOther Intangible Assets\\nWe amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful\\nlives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. The cost of intangible assets is generally amortized on a\\nstraight-line basis over the asset\\'s estimated economic life. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for\\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be\\nrecoverable. In these circumstances, they are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if\\nimpaired, written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. Intangible\\nassets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment and written down to fair value as required.\\nRefer to the Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets accounting policy.\\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Long-lived Assets\\nWe perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on a qualitative or quantitative basis for\\neach of our reporting units as of July 1, or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may\\nexist at the reporting unit level. When performing the annual impairment test we have the option of first\\nperforming a qualitative assessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a\\ndetermination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\\namount. If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment\\nassessment of goodwill. However, if the assessment leads to a determination that it is more likely than not\\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then no further assessments are\\nrequired. A quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment is made by comparing the carrying\\namount of each reporting unit with its fair value, which is generally calculated using a\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 59\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncombination of market, comparable transaction and discounted cash flow approaches. See \"Note\\n6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" for further information on valuation methodology and impairment of\\ngoodwill.\\nWe review PP&E, intangible assets and certain other long-lived assets for impairment\\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and at\\nleast annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. When testing for impairment, we group our long-lived\\nassets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group).  The determination of\\nrecoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. The amount of impairment\\nloss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flow analysis, with\\nthe carrying value of the related assets.\\nFinancial Instruments\\nOur financial instruments include cash and equivalents, current receivables, investments,\\naccounts payables, short and long-term debt, and derivative financial instruments.\\nWe monitor our exposure to various business risks including commodity prices and foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates and we regularly use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. At the\\ninception of a new derivative, we designate the derivative as a hedge or we determine the derivative to be\\nundesignated as a hedging instrument. We document the relationships between the hedging instruments and the\\nhedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge\\ntransactions. We assess whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in\\noffsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item at both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing\\nbasis.\\nWe have a program that utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risks\\nassociated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to have\\ngains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the foreign currency transaction and\\ntranslation gains or losses to the extent practical. These foreign currency exposures typically arise from\\nchanges in the value of assets (for example, current receivables) and liabilities (for example, current\\npayables) which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity. We\\nrecord all derivatives as of the end of our reporting period in our consolidated and combined statement of\\nfinancial position at fair value. For the forward contracts held as undesignated hedging instruments, we record\\nthe changes in fair value of the forward contracts in our consolidated and combined statements of income along\\nwith the change in the fair value, related to foreign exchange movements, of the hedged item. Changes in the\\nfair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recognized in other\\ncomprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. If derivatives designated as a cash flow\\nhedge are determined to be ineffective, the ineffective portion of that derivative\\'s change in fair value is\\nrecognized in earnings.\\nFair Value Measurements\\nFor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value\\nis the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a\\nmarket participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or\\nliabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the\\nabsence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a\\nhypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date.\\nObservable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable\\ninputs reflect our market assumptions. Preference is given to observable inputs. These two types of inputs\\ncreate the following fair value hierarchy:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical\\nor similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable\\nor whose significant value drivers are observable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 60\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\n\\n\\nLevel 3 - Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe maintain policies and procedures to value instruments using the best and most relevant data\\navailable. In addition, we perform reviews to assess the reasonableness of the valuations. With regard to Level\\n3 valuations (including instruments valued by third parties), we perform a variety of procedures to assess the\\nreasonableness of the valuations. Such reviews include an evaluation of instruments whose fair value change\\nexceeds predefined thresholds (and/or does not change) and consider the current interest rate, currency and\\ncredit environment, as well as other published data, such as rating agency market reports and current\\nappraisals.\\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\\nDerivatives\\nWhen we have Level 1 derivatives, which are traded either on exchanges or liquid\\nover-the-counter markets, we use closing prices for valuation. The majority of our derivatives are valued using\\ninternal models and are included in Level 2. These internal models maximize the use of market observable inputs\\nincluding interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative\\nassets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent foreign currency and commodity forward contracts\\nfor the Company.\\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities\\n \\nWhen available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of investment\\nsecurities, and they are included in Level 1. Level 1 securities primarily include publicly traded equity\\nsecurities.\\n\\nFor investment securities for which market prices are observable for identical or similar\\ninvestment securities but not readily accessible for each of those investments individually (that is, it is\\ndifficult to obtain pricing information for each individual investment security at the measurement date), we\\nuse pricing models that are consistent with what other market participants would use. The inputs and\\nassumptions to the models are derived from market observable sources including: benchmark yields, reported\\ntrades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and other market-related\\ndata. Thus, certain securities may not be priced using quoted prices, but rather determined from market\\nobservable information. These investments are included in Level 2. When we use valuations that are based on\\nsignificant unobservable inputs we classify the investment securities in Level 3.\\nNon-Recurring Fair Value Measurements\\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are not\\nmeasured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain\\ncircumstances. These assets can include long-lived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are\\nheld for sale, cost and equity method investments and long-lived assets that are written down to fair value\\nwhen they are impaired and the remeasurement of retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon\\na change in control that results in a deconsolidation of a subsidiary, if we sell a controlling interest and\\nretain a noncontrolling stake in the entity. Assets that are written down to fair value when impaired and\\nretained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.\\nCost and Equity Method Investments\\nCost and equity method investments are valued using market observable data such as quoted\\nprices when available. When market observable data is unavailable, investments are valued using a discounted\\ncash flow model, comparative market multiples or a combination of both approaches as appropriate and other\\nthird-party pricing sources.\\nLong-lived Assets\\nFair values of long-lived assets, including real estate, are primarily derived internally and\\nare based on observed sales transactions for similar assets. In other instances, for example, collateral types\\nfor which\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 61\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe do not have comparable observed sales transaction data, collateral values are developed\\ninternally and corroborated by external appraisal information. Adjustments to third-party valuations may be\\nperformed in circumstances where market comparables are not specific to the attributes of the specific\\ncollateral or appraisal information may not be reflective of current market conditions due to the passage of\\ntime and the occurrence of market events since receipt of the information.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe file U.S. federal and state income tax returns which after the closing of the Transactions\\nprimarily includes our distributive share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction of BHGE LLC which is\\ntreated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes. As such, BHGE LLC will not itself be subject to U.S. federal\\nincome tax under current U.S. tax laws. Non-U.S. current and deferred income taxes owed by the subsidiaries of\\nBHGE LLC are reflected in the financial statements.\\nPrior to the closing of the Transactions, the business was included in the consolidated U.S.\\nfederal, foreign and state income tax returns of GE, where allowable by law.   Our prior year current and\\ndeferred taxes were determined based upon the separate return method (i.e., as if we were a taxpayer separate\\nfrom GE). \\nWe account for taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income\\ntaxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets\\nand liabilities as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, based on enacted tax rates\\nexpected to be in effect when taxes actually are paid or recovered and other provisions of the tax law. The\\neffect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the\\nperiod in which such change is enacted. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of\\nsuch benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred\\ntax asset that management believes may not be realized.\\nWe provide U.S. deferred taxes on our outside basis difference in our investment in BHGE LLC.\\nIn determining the basis difference, we exclude non-deductible goodwill and the basis difference related to\\ncertain foreign corporations owned by BHGE LLC where the undistributed earnings of the foreign corporation have\\nbeen, or will be, reinvested indefinitely.\\nDue to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be\\nfree of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes, such as withholding or state taxes. Indefinite reinvestment\\nis determined by management\\'s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company.\\nMost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. At December 31, 2017, we\\nhave not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision as a result of U.S. tax reform but will reassess this\\nduring the course of 2018, accordingly, we have not provided income tax on such earnings. It is not practicable\\nto determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested\\nindefinitely.\\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in\\nevaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We operate in more than 120 countries and our tax filings are subject to audit by the tax authorities in\\nthe jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that\\nare resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts that we believe\\nwill ultimately result from these proceedings. We recognize uncertain tax positions that are \"more likely than\\nnot\" to be sustained if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the\\nrelevant facts and other information. For those tax positions that meet this threshold, we measure the amount\\nof tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% chance of being realized in a final settlement with the relevant authority.\\nWe classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. The effects\\nof tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in the combined financial statements\\nin the period they are recorded.\\n\\nAdditionally, as part of U.S. tax reform, the U.S. has enacted a tax on \"base eroding\"\\npayments from the U.S. and a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low-taxed income). Because\\naspects of the new minimum tax and the effect on our operations is uncertain and because aspects of the\\naccounting rules associated with this\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 62\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nprovision have not been resolved, we have not made a provisional accrual for the deferred tax\\naspects of this provision and consequently have not made an accounting policy election on the deferred tax\\ntreatment of this tax.\\nEnvironmental Liabilities\\nWe are involved in numerous remediation actions to clean up hazardous waste as required by\\nfederal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs exclude possible insurance recoveries and, when dates\\nand amounts of such costs are not known, are not discounted. When there appears to be a range of possible costs\\nwith equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low end of such range. It is reasonably possible that our\\nenvironmental remediation exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status\\nof laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites, such amounts are not reasonably\\nestimable. The determination of the required accruals for remediation costs is subject to uncertainty,\\nincluding the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the difficulty in estimating the extent and type\\nof remediation activity that is necessary.\\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED\\nASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\\nBackground\\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new comprehensive set of\\nrevenue recognition principles, Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with\\nCustomers, that supersedes most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance (including ASC 605-35, Revenue\\nRecognition - Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts). The new standard will become effective for\\nannual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018 and will\\napply it retrospectively to all periods presented and will elect the practical expedient for contract\\nmodifications. Since the issuance of the new standard by the FASB, we have engaged in a collaborative process\\nwith our industry peers and worked with standard setters on important interpretive matters with the objective\\nof ensuring consistency in the application of the standard.\\nChange in Timing and Presentation, No Impact to Cash or Economics\\nThe new standard requires companies to identify contractual performance obligations and\\ndetermine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time based on when control of goods\\nand services transfer to a customer. As a result, we expect changes in the presentation of our financial\\nstatements, including: (1) timing of revenue recognition, and (2) changes in classification between revenue and\\ncosts. The new standard will have no cash impact and, as such, does not affect the economics of our underlying\\ncustomer contracts. The effect of applying the new guidance to our existing book of contracts will result in\\nlower reported earnings in 2018 (and comparative periods previously reported) and in the early years after\\nadoption. However, we expect to experience an increase in reported earnings, on that existing book of\\ncontracts, as they mature.\\nCurrent Estimate of Financial Statement Effect\\nWe adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018. When we report our 2018\\nresults, the comparative results for 2017 and 2016 will be updated to reflect the application of the\\nrequirements of the new standard to these periods.  Based on our assessment and best estimates to date, we\\nexpect an after-tax reduction to our January 1, 2016 retained earnings balance of approximately\\n$0.4 billion, with an estimated after-tax reduction of\\n$0.1 billion and $0.1 billion\\non our 2016 and 2017 earnings, respectively. These adjustments primarily relate to the timing\\nof revenue recognition on our long-term product service agreements. Beyond those effects, we expect application\\nof the new guidance will result in increases and decreases in revenue within our segments, which will largely\\noffset and will be immaterial at a total Company level. Following adoption in 2018, our books and records will\\nonly reflect the results as required under the new standard limiting our ability to estimate the effect of the\\nstandard on our earnings. Given the inherent difficulty in this ongoing estimation of the effect of the\\nstandard on any future periods, we do not plan to continue to assess the effect on 2018.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 63\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs discussed above, we anticipate a dilutive effect of the new standard in the year of\\nadoption consistent with the effect to the restated 2016 and 2017 results and the effect will be less dilutive\\nfor years after initial adoption. However, this expectation is based on many variables, including underlying\\nbusiness performance, which are subject to change, making the effect of the standard on future periods\\ndifficult to estimate. Importantly, application of the new guidance has no effect on the cash we expect to\\nreceive nor the economics of these contracts.\\nASU No. 2016-02, Leases\\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a\\nlessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than\\n12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern\\nof expense recognition. Similarly, lessors will be required to classify leases as sales-type, finance or\\noperating, with classification affecting the pattern of income recognition. Classification for both lessees and\\nlessors will be based on an assessment of whether risks and rewards as well as substantive control have been\\ntransferred through a lease contract. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December\\n15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. A modified\\nretrospective transition approach is required for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of\\nthe earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients\\navailable. While we continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting, we\\nanticipate that the adoption of the ASU may materially affect our consolidated and combined financial\\nstatements.\\nASU No. 2016-16, Accounting for Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other\\nthan Inventory\\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Accounting for Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than\\nInventory. The ASU eliminates the deferral of tax effects of intra-entity asset\\ntransfers other than inventory. As a result, the tax expense from the intercompany sale of assets, other than\\ninventory, and associated changes to deferred taxes will be recognized when the sale occurs even though the\\npre-tax effects of the transaction have not been recognized. The new standard is effective for annual periods\\nbeginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The effect of the adoption\\nof the standard will depend on the nature and amount of future transactions but is currently expected as an\\nincrease to retained earnings of approximately $0.3 billion.\\nFuture earnings will be reduced in total by this amount. The effect of the change on future transactions will\\ndepend on the nature and amount of future transactions as it will affect the timing of recognition of both tax\\nexpenses and tax benefits, with no change in the associated cash flows.\\nASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic\\nPostretirement Benefit Cost\\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit\\nCost, which changes the income statement presentation of net periodic benefit cost by\\nrequiring separation between the service cost component and all other components. The service cost component is\\nrequired to be presented as an operating expense with other similar compensation costs arising for services\\nrendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The non-operating components must be presented outside\\nof income from operations. This pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after\\nDecember 15, 2017, and the presentation disclosure should be applied using a retrospective approach. Early\\nadoption is permitted. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2018. The effect of the adoption of this standard\\nwill not have a material impact on our consolidated and combined financial statement.\\nAll other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet effective are\\ncurrently being evaluated and at this time are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position\\nor results of operations.\\n\\nNOTE 2. BUSINESS ACQUISITION\\nOn July 3, 2017, we closed the Transactions to combine GE O&G and Baker Hughes, creating a\\nworld-leading, fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of equipment and service\\ncapabilities. The Transactions were executed using a partnership structure, pursuant to which GE O&G and\\nBaker Hughes each\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 64\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncontributed their operating assets to a newly formed partnership, BHGE LLC. As a partnership,\\nBHGE LLC\\nwill not itself be subject to U.S. federal income tax under current U.S. tax\\nlaws. BHGE LLC\\'s foreign subsidiaries, however, are expected to incur current and deferred foreign income\\ntaxes. GE holds an approximate 62.5% controlling interest in\\nthis partnership and former Baker Hughes stockholders hold an approximate 37.5%\\ninterest through the ownership of 100% of\\nour Class A common stock. GE holds its voting interest through our Class B common stock and its economic\\ninterest through a corresponding number of common units of BHGE LLC. Former Baker Hughes stockholders\\nimmediately after the completion of the Transactions also received a special dividend of $17.50 per share paid by the Company to holders of record of the Company\\'s Class\\nA common stock. GE contributed $7.4 billion to BHGE LLC to\\nfund substantially all of the special dividend.\\nPrior to the Transactions, shares of Baker Hughes common stock were registered pursuant to\\nSection 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and listed on the New York\\nStock Exchange and the SIX Swiss Exchange. Shares of Baker Hughes common stock were suspended from trading on\\nthe New York Stock Exchange and the SIX Swiss Exchange prior to the open of trading on July 5, 2017. The New\\nYork Stock Exchange filed a Form 25 on Baker Hughes\\' behalf to provide notice to the SEC regarding the\\nwithdrawal of shares of Baker Hughes common stock from listing and to terminate the registration of such shares\\nunder Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.\\nAs a result of the Transactions, on July 3, 2017, the Company issued\\n428 million shares of Class A common stock to the former\\nstockholders of Baker Hughes and 717 million shares of Class\\nB common stock to GE. The issuance of the Company\\'s Class A common stock in connection with the Transactions\\nwas registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), pursuant to BHGE\\'s\\nregistration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-216991), as amended, filed with the SEC by BHGE and declared\\neffective on May 30, 2017. Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act, BHGE is the successor issuer to\\nBaker Hughes with respect to the common stock of Baker Hughes. Therefore, the Class A common stock is deemed to\\nbe registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and BHGE is subject to the requirements of the Exchange\\nAct.\\nBased on the relative voting rights of former Baker Hughes stockholders and GE immediately\\nfollowing completion of the Transactions, and after taking into consideration all relevant facts, GE O&G is\\nconsidered to be the \"acquirer\" for accounting purposes. As a result, the Transactions are reported as a\\nbusiness combination using the acquisition method of accounting with GE O&G treated as the \"acquirer\" and\\nBaker Hughes treated as the \"acquired\" company.\\nThe tables below present the fair value of the consideration exchanged and the preliminary\\nestimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the associated fair value of the\\nnoncontrolling interest related to the acquired net assets of Baker Hughes. The final determination of fair\\nvalue for certain assets and liabilities will be completed as soon as the information necessary to complete the\\nanalysis is obtained. These amounts, which may differ materially from these preliminary estimates, will\\ncontinue to be refined and will be finalized as soon as possible, but no later than one year from the\\nacquisition date. The primary areas of the preliminary estimates that are not yet finalized relate to\\ninventory, property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangible assets, equity-method investments, deferred\\nincome taxes, uncertain tax positions and contingencies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPurchase consideration\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(In millions, except share and per share amounts)\\n\\n\\nJuly 3, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes shares outstanding\\n\\n\\n426,097,407\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRestricted stock units vested upon closing\\n\\n\\n1,611,566\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal Baker Hughes shares outstanding for purchase consideration\\n\\n\\n427,708,973\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes share price on July 3, 2017 per share\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n57.68\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPurchase consideration\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n24,670\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRollover of outstanding options into options to purchase Class A shares (fair value)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n114\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrecombination service of restricted stock units (fair value)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal purchase consideration\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n24,798\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 65\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPreliminary identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed\\n\\n\\nEstimated fair value at July 3, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssets\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCash and equivalents\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n4,133\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent receivables\\n\\n\\n2,383\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInventories (1)\\n\\n\\n1,695\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment\\n\\n\\n4,868\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntangible assets (2)\\n\\n\\n4,123\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll other assets\\n\\n\\n1,544\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLiabilities\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccounts payable\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(1,106\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBorrowings\\n\\n\\n(3,370\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeferred income taxes (3)\\n\\n\\n(317\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLiabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits\\n\\n\\n(655\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll other liabilities\\n\\n\\n(1,476\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal identifiable net assets\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n11,822\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNoncontrolling interest associated with net assets acquired\\n\\n\\n(76\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoodwill (4)\\n\\n\\n13,052\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal purchase consideration\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n24,798\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) \\n\\n\\nIncludes $87 million of\\nadjustments to write-up the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value.

Goodwill resulting from the Transactions has been preliminarily allocated to the Oilfield\\nServices segment, of which $67 million is deductible for tax\\npurposes.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company made measurement period\\nadjustments to reflect facts and circumstances in existence as of the acquisition date. These adjustments\\nresulted in a decrease in goodwill of approximately $401 million mostly due to the step-up to fair value of property, plant and equipment of $682\\nmillion partially offset by a reduction in intangible assets of $367 million. As a result of the increase in property, plant and equipment and\\nthe reduction of intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a net increase\\nto\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 66\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndepreciation and amortization expense of $63\\nmillion, which adjusts the depreciation and amortization expense to the amount that\\nwould have been recorded in previous interim reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had\\nbeen recognized as of the acquisition date. In addition, we reclassified certain balances to conform to our\\ncurrent presentation. Additionally, approximately $343 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards offset with a valuation allowance were recorded related to foreign\\nearnings that were not considered to be permanently reinvested. The acquisition of Baker Hughes contributed\\nrevenue of approximately $5,184 million and pretax segment\\noperating income of approximately $256 million for the period\\nfrom July 3, 2017 through December 31, 2017. \\nINCOME TAXES\\nBHGE LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, BHGE LLC\\nwill not itself be subject to U.S. federal income tax under current U.S. tax laws. The members of BHGE LLC will\\neach be required to take into account for U.S. federal income tax purposes their distributive share of the\\nitems of income, gain, loss and deduction of BHGE LLC, which generally will include the U.S. operations of both\\nBaker Hughes and GE O&G. BHGE and GE will each be taxed on their distributive share of income and gain,\\nwhether or not a corresponding amount of cash or other property is distributed to them. For assets held\\nindirectly by BHGE LLC through subsidiaries, the taxes attributable to those subsidiaries will be reflected in\\nour consolidated and combined financial statements.\\nMERGER AND RELATED COSTS\\nDuring 2017, 2016 and 2015, acquisition costs of $373 million, $33 million and $27 million, respectively, were expensed as\\nincurred and were reported as merger and related costs. Costs in 2017 include severance and other separation\\npayments made to certain executive officers of Baker Hughes related to change-in-control with double trigger\\nprovisions in their existing employment agreements, professional fees of advisors, and integration and synergy\\ncosts related to the combination of Baker Hughes and GE O&G. The double-trigger provisions resulted in\\npayments to executives of Baker Hughes following two events: a change-in-control and termination or reduction\\nin the responsibilities of the executives. BHGE terminated the employment of certain executives following the\\nbusiness combination.\\nUNAUDITED ACTUAL AND PRO FORMA INFORMATION\\nThe following unaudited pro forma information has been presented as if the Transactions\\noccurred on January 1, 2016. This information has been prepared by combining the historical results of GE\\nO&G and historical results of Baker Hughes. The unaudited pro forma combined financial data for all periods\\npresented were adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that 1) are directly attributable to the\\naforementioned Transactions, 2) factually supportable, and 3) expected to have a continuing impact on the\\nconsolidated results of operations. The adjustments are based on information available to the Company at this\\ntime. Accordingly, the adjustments are subject to change and the impact of such changes may be material. The\\nunaudited pro forma results do not include any incremental cost savings that may result from the\\nintegration.\\nThe unaudited combined pro forma information is for informational purposes only and is not\\nnecessarily indicative of what the combined company\\'s results actually would have been had the acquisition been\\ncompleted as of the beginning of the periods as indicated. In addition, the unaudited pro forma information\\ndoes not purport to project the future results of the combined company.\\n\\nSignificant adjustments to the pro forma information below include\\nrecognition of non-recurring direct incremental acquisition costs in 2016 and exclusion of those costs from all\\nother years presented; amortization associated with an estimate of the acquired intangible assets; depreciation\\nassociated with an estimate of the fair value step-up of property, plant and equipment; and reduction of\\ninterest expense for fair value adjustments to debt. A non-recurring contractually obligated termination fee\\nof $3,500 million ($3,301\\nmillion net of related costs incurred) received by Baker Hughes due to an inability to\\nobtain antitrust related approvals from a prior merger agreement is recognized in 2016.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 67\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n21,921\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n23,102\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNet loss\\n\\n\\n(335\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(2,734\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNet loss attributable to the Company\\n\\n\\n(92\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(998\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLoss per Class A share - basic and diluted (1)\\n\\n\\n(0.22\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(2.33\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) \\n\\n\\nThe calculation of diluted loss per Class A share excludes shares potentially issuable under\\nstock-based incentive compensation plans and the exchange of Class B shares with Class A shares under the\\nExchange Agreement, as their effect, if included, would be antidilutive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNOTE 3.

This amount and its\\nallocations to segments are preliminary.\\n\\n\\n\\nSubsequent to the close of the acquisition of Baker Hughes, we realigned our\\nreporting units to Oilfield Services (OFS), Oilfield Equipment (OFE), Turbomachinery & Process Solutions\\n(TPS) and Digital Solutions (DS) (refer to \"Note 15. Segment Information\") and reallocated the goodwill that\\nexisted as of June 30, 2017 to the new reportable segments for all historical periods presented. The majority\\nof Baker Hughes business was combined with the GE O&G Surface business to create the new Oilfield Services\\nreporting segment. Our reporting units are the same as our four reportable segments.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 69\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year using data as of\\nJuly 1 of that year, which would include consideration of any segment realignment. The impairment test consists\\nof two steps: in step one, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value; in step\\ntwo, which is applied only when the carrying value is more than its fair value, the amount of goodwill\\nimpairment, if any, is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit\\'s assets and liabilities from\\nthe fair value of its equity, and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill.  We determined\\nfair values for each of the reporting units using a combination of the market approach and the income approach.\\nWe assessed the valuation methodologies based upon the relevance and available data and have weighted the\\nresults appropriately.\\nValuations using the market approach were derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or\\nhistorically completed transactions of comparable businesses. The selection of comparable businesses was based\\non the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and\\ndiversity of products and services. A market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are\\npublicly traded companies that have the characteristics similar to our businesses.\\nUnder the income approach, fair value was determined based on the present\\nvalue of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We used our internal\\nforecasts to estimate future cash flows and included an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our\\nmost recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. Actual results may differ from those assumed in\\nour forecasts. We derived our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates\\nfor industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. We used discount rates\\nthat are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our\\ninternally developed forecasts. Discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from\\n10% to 11%.\\nEstimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are\\nbased on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is reasonably possible that the judgments\\nand estimates described above could change in future periods.\\n\\nIn performing the annual impairment test for goodwill in the third quarter\\nof 2015 using data as of July 1 of that year, we determined that a step two test was required for a reporting\\nunit within our OFS operating segment. As a consequence of the continued pressure on oil prices, the revised\\nexpected cash flows for this reporting unit resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $2,080 million. The impairment charge has been included as part of \"Impairment\\nof goodwill\" in the consolidated and combined statement of income (loss).\\nWe performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of July 1, 2017 and July 1, 2016 for\\nall of our reporting units. Based on the results of our step one testing, the fair values of each of the\\nreporting units exceeded their carrying values; therefore, the second step of the impairment test was not\\nrequired to be performed for any of our reporting units and no goodwill impairment was recognized.\\nIn addition to our annual impairment testing, we also test goodwill for impairment between\\nannual impairment testing dates whenever events or circumstances occur that, in our judgment, could more likely\\nthan not reduce the fair value of one or more reporting units below its carrying amount. In assessing the\\npossibility that a reporting unit\\'s fair value has been reduced below its carrying amount due to the occurrence\\nof events or circumstances between annual impairment testing dates, we consider all available evidence,\\nincluding (but not limited to) (i) the results of our impairment testing at the prior annual impairment testing\\ndate (in particular, the magnitude of the excess of fair value over carrying value observed), (ii) downward\\nrevisions to internal forecasts (and the magnitude thereof), if any, and (iii) declines in our market\\ncapitalization below our book value (and the magnitude and duration of those declines), if any. Between July 1,\\n2017 and December 31, 2017, we have not identified any events or circumstances that could more likely than not\\nreduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying amount. However, there can be no\\nassurances that further sustained declines in macroeconomic or business conditions affecting our industry and\\nbusinesses (i) will not occur and, (ii) were they to occur, that those further sustained declines will not\\nresult in additional impairments in future periods.\\nAs of December 31, 2017,\\nwe believe that the goodwill is recoverable for all the reporting units, however, there can be no assurances\\nthat the goodwill will not be impaired in future periods.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 70\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\\nIntangible assets are comprised of the following at December 31:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nGross Carrying Amount\\n\\n\\nAccumulated Amortization\\n\\n\\nNet\\n\\n\\nGross Carrying Amount\\n\\n\\nAccumulated Amortization\\n\\n\\nNet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTechnology\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n1,177\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(440\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n737\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n596\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(371\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n225\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomer relationships\\n\\n\\n3,202\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(819\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n2,383\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,920\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(660\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n1,260\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCapitalized software\\n\\n\\n1,130\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(697\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n433\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n896\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(535\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n361\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrade names and trademarks\\n\\n\\n757\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(159\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n598\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n681\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(130\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n551\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinite-lived intangible assets\\n\\n\\n6,276\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(2,115\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n4,161\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4,094\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1,697\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n2,397\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets (1)\\n\\n\\n2,197\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2,197\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal intangible assets\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n8,473\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(2,115\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n6,358\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n4,146\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(1,697\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n2,449\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) \\n\\n\\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets principally comprise trade names and trademarks acquired\\nin business combinations.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinite-lived intangible assets increased by $1,764\\nmillion for the year ended December 31,\\n2017, primarily as a result of the acquired Baker Hughes intangible assets offset by\\namortization during the periods (refer to \"Note 2.

The maximum combined borrowing at any time under both the 2017 Credit Agreement\\nand the commercial paper program is $3 billion. \\nOn December 11, 2017, BHGE LLC completed a private placement offering\\n$3,950 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes,\\nconsisting of $1,250 million aggregate principal amount\\nof 2.773% Senior Notes due 2022, $1,350 million aggregate principal amount of 3.337% Senior Notes due 2027 and $1,350 million\\naggregate principal amount of 4.080% Senior\\nNotes due 2047. These Senior Notes are presented net of issuance costs of $26\\nmillion in our consolidated and combined statement of financial position. BHGE LLC\\nwill pay interest on each series of Exchange Notes on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June\\n15, 2018. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of BHGE LLC\\'s\\nexisting and future senior indebtedness; senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness;\\nand effectively junior to BHGE LLC\\'s future secured indebtedness, if any, and to all existing and future\\nindebtedness of its subsidiaries. BHGE LLC may redeem, at its option, all or part of the Notes at any time, at\\nthe applicable make-whole redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The\\nSenior Notes contain covenants that restrict BHGE LLC\\'s ability to take certain actions, including, but not\\nlimited to, the creation of certain liens securing debt, the entry into certain sale-leaseback transactions and\\nengaging in certain merger, consolidation and asset sale transactions in excess of specified\\nlimits.\\nBHGE LLC used a portion of the net proceeds from the private placement of\\nthe Senior Notes to fund the purchase of $82 million of 7.5% senior notes due 2018, $25 million of 6.0% senior\\nnotes due 2018, $6 million of 8.55% debentures due 2024 and $62 million\\nof 6.875% notes due 2029 that were validly\\ntendered in connection with the cash tender offers commenced by BHGE LLC on December 4, 2017. Under the cash\\ntender offer BHGE LLC purchased a further $3 million of 6.875% notes due 2029 in January 2018. BHGE LLC also\\nredeemed in January 2018 all remaining aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Senior Notes of\\n$615 million that were not tendered for purchase in accordance with\\nthe relevant indentures.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\\nGE MULTI-EMPLOYER PLANS\\n\\nCertain of our U.S. employees are covered under various U.S. GE employee\\nbenefit plans, including GE\\'s retirement plans (pension, retiree health and life insurance, and savings benefit\\nplans). In addition, certain United Kingdom (UK) employees participate in the GE UK Pension Plan. We are\\nallocated relevant participation costs for these GE employee benefit plans as part of multi-employer plans. As\\nsuch, we have not recorded any liabilities associated with our participation in these plans. Expenses\\nassociated with our participation in these plans was $132 million, $140 million and $148\\nmillion in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,\\nrespectively.\\nDuring 2016, two UK\\npension plans sponsored by us, the 1987 Vetco Gray Hughes Pension Plan and the UK Dresser Pension Scheme, were\\nmerged into the GE UK Pension Plan. We agreed to pay deficit contributions for the next 10 years. The estimated present value of these payments is approximately\\n$15 million and is recorded in the consolidated and combined\\nStatement of Financial Position in \"All other liabilities.\"  Subsequent to that merger, plan participants in\\nthese respective plans participate in the GE UK Pension Plan.\\nDEFINED BENEFIT PLANS\\nIn addition to these GE plans, certain of our employees are also covered by\\ncompany sponsored pension plans. Our pension plans in 2017 included seven\\nU.S. plans and six non-U.S. pension plans,\\nprimarily in the UK, Germany, and Canada, all with pension assets or obligations greater than\\n$20 million. We use a December 31 measurement date for these plans.\\nThese defined benefit plans generally provide benefits to employees based on formulas recognizing length of\\nservice and earnings. We also provide certain postretirement health care benefits (\"Other Postretirement\\nBenefits\"), through an unfunded plan, to a closed group of U.S. employees who retire and have met certain age\\nand service requirements.\\nFunded Status\\nThe funded status position represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the\\nplan assets. The projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension benefits represents the actuarial present value\\nof benefits attributed to employee services and compensation and includes an assumption about future\\ncompensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the actuarial present value of pension\\nbenefits attributed to employee service to date and present compensation levels. The ABO differs from the PBO\\nin that the ABO does not include any assumptions about future compensation levels.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 74\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBelow is the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of benefit obligations, fair\\nvalue of plan assets and the funded status of our plans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nPension Benefits\\n\\n\\nOther Postretirement\\nBenefits\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChange in benefit obligation:\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n820\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n1,290\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n117\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n136\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nService cost\\n\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInterest cost\\n\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlan amendment\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(23\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(5\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nActuarial loss (gain)\\n\\n\\n41\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(14\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBenefits paid\\n\\n\\n(65\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(39\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(13\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(6\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurtailments\\n\\n\\n(45\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSettlements\\n\\n\\n(10\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBusiness acquisition\\n(1)\\n\\n\\n1,546\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n93\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther (2)\\n\\n\\n(2\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(460\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForeign currency translation adjustments\\n\\n\\n45\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(62\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBenefit obligation at end of year\\n\\n\\n2,418\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n820\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n187\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n117\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChange in plan assets:\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\\n\\n\\n567\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n915\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nActual return on plan assets\\n\\n\\n152\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n43\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEmployer contributions\\n\\n\\n50\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n50\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBenefits paid\\n\\n\\n(65\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(39\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(13\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(6\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSettlements\\n\\n\\n(10\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBusiness acquisition(1)\\n\\n\\n1,342\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther (2)\\n\\n\\n(2\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(358\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForeign currency translation adjustments\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(44\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFair value of plan assets at end of year\\n\\n\\n2,059\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n567\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunded status -

INCOME TAXES\\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform) that lowers\\nthe statutory tax rate on U.S. earnings, taxes historic foreign earnings previously deferred from U.S. taxation\\nat a reduced rate of tax (transition tax), establishes a territorial tax system and enacts new taxes associated\\nwith global operations.\\nThe impact of U.S. tax reform has been recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation\\nprovides for additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on several provisions\\nincluding the computation of the transition tax. Guidance in 2018 could impact the information required for and\\nthe calculation of the transition tax charge and could affect decisions that affect the tax on various U.S. and\\nforeign items which would further impact the final amounts included in the transition tax charge and impact the\\nrevaluation of deferred taxes. In addition, analysis performed and conclusions reached as part of the tax\\nreturn filing process and additional guidance on accounting for tax reform could affect the provisional amount.\\nAs part of purchase accounting for the Baker Hughes acquisition, we have made preliminary estimates of the fair\\nvalue of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Accordingly, changes to these estimates resulting from the\\nfinalization of the fair values may also require us to adjust the provisional impact of U.S. tax reform.\\nAdditionally, as part of U.S. tax reform, the U.S. has enacted a tax on \"base eroding\"\\npayments from the U.S. and a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low-taxed income). Because\\naspects of the new law and the effect on our operations is uncertain and because aspects of the accounting\\nrules associated with this provision have not been resolved, we have not made a provisional accrual for the\\ndeferred tax aspects of this provision and consequently have not made an accounting policy election on the\\ndeferred tax treatment of this tax.\\n\\nAs a result of enactment of U.S. tax reform, we have recorded a net tax\\nbenefit of $132 million in 2017 to reflect our provisional\\nestimate of the revaluation of deferred taxes. We also recorded tax expense of $271\\nmillion to reflect our provisional estimate of the transition tax charge on historic\\nforeign earnings. This transition tax charge is completely offset with a tax benefit from a valuation allowance\\nrelease on foreign tax credits available to offset the tax.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 79\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe provision or benefit for income taxes is comprised of the following for the years ended\\nDecember 31:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent:\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S.\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(33\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(114\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n158\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForeign\\n\\n\\n408\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n325\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n411\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal current\\n\\n\\n375\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n211\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n569\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeferred:\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S.\\n\\n\\n(257\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(21\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForeign\\n\\n\\n(47\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(75\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal deferred\\n\\n\\n(304\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(96\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProvision for income taxes\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n71\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n250\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n473\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe geographic sources of income (loss) before income taxes, inclusive of equity in loss of\\naffiliate are as follows for the years ended December 31:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S.\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(1,153\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(440\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(2,006\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForeign\\n\\n\\n982\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,848\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome (loss) before income taxes, inclusive of equity in loss of affiliate\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(171\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n584\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(158\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe benefit or provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the\\nU.S. statutory income tax rate to the loss or income before income taxes for the reasons set forth below for\\nthe years ended December 31:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome (loss) before income taxes, inclusive of equity in loss of affiliate\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(171\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n584\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(158\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTaxes at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate\\n\\n\\n(60\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n205\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(55\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEffect of foreign operations\\n\\n\\n(50\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(5\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(137\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTax impact of partnership structure\\n\\n\\n167\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTax impact of dispositions\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(26\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNondeductible goodwill\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n713\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChange in valuation allowances\\n\\n\\n169\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act enactment\\n\\n\\n(132\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther -

The increase in tax\\ncredit carryforwards of approximately $549 million is\\nprimarily due to the generation of foreign tax credits under U.S. tax law related to the business acquisition\\nreferred to in Note 2 partially offset by the U.S. tax reform transition tax. Additionally, we had\\n$1,376 million of net operating loss carryforwards, of which\\napproximately $319 million will expire within\\nfive years, $293 million\\nwill expire between six and\\n20 years, and the remainder can be carried forward\\nindefinitely.\\nWe record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some\\nportion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax\\nassets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future\\nand in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. At December 31, 2017, $2,474 million of valuation allowances are recorded\\nagainst various deferred tax assets, including foreign net operating losses (NOL) of $1,125 million, U.S. federal and foreign tax credit carryforwards of\\n$524 million, other U.S. NOL\\'s and tax credit carryforwards\\nof $57 million, and certain other U.S. and foreign deferred\\ntax assets of $768 million. The increase of\\n$2,387 million in valuation allowances are primarily related to the\\nbusiness acquisition.\\nDue to cumulative losses in the U.S., we concluded that valuation allowances\\nwere required on the majority of our U.S. net deferred tax assets, including foreign tax credit\\ncarryforwards.\\nCertain other U.S. tax reform provisions could impact the amount of our U.S.\\nvaluation allowance assessment. Our assessment is provisional and amounts may be updated as we finalize our\\naccounting for U.S. tax reform in 2018. There are $192 million of deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards without a valuation allowance\\nas we expect that the deferred tax assets will be realized within the carryforward period.\\nSubstantially all of our undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely\\nreinvested. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free\\nof U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is\\ndetermined by management\\'s intentions concerning the future operations of the Company.

However, as a result of U.S. tax reform,\\nsubstantially all of our prior unrepatriated foreign earnings were subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we\\nexpect to have the ability to repatriate those earnings without incremental U.S. federal tax cost. We expect\\nthat any foreign withholding taxes on such a repatriation would generate a U.S. foreign tax credit.\\nWe will update our analysis of investment of foreign earnings in 2018 as we consider the\\nimpact of U.S. tax reform. As of December 31, 2017, the cumulative amount of indefinitely reinvested foreign\\nearnings is approximately $8.0 billion. Computation of the\\npotential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences\\nis not practicable.\\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $395 million\\nof tax liabilities for total gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax\\npositions. In addition to these uncertain tax positions, we had $95 million\\nand $53 million related to interest and\\npenalties, respectively, for total liabilities of $543 million for uncertain positions. If we were to prevail on all uncertain positions, the net effect would result in\\nan income tax benefit of approximately $522 million. The\\nremaining $21 million is offset by deferred tax assets that\\nrepresent tax benefits that would be received in different taxing jurisdictions in the event that we did not\\nprevail on all uncertain tax positions.\\nWe have not provided for any unrecognized tax benefits related to U.S. tax reform in our\\nprovisional estimate.

A total of up to 57.4\\nmillion shares of Class A common stock are authorized for\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 82\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nissuance pursuant to awards granted under the LTI Plan over its term which\\nexpires on the date of the annual meeting of the Company in 2027. A total of 53.7\\nmillion shares of Class A common stock are available for issuance as of December 31,\\n2017.\\nAs a result of the acquisition of Baker Hughes, on July 3, 2017, each outstanding Baker Hughes stock option was converted into an\\noption to purchase a share of Class A common stock in the Company. Consequently, we issued 6.8 million stock options which are fully vested. Each\\nconverted option is subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original option, and the per\\nshare exercise price of each converted option was reduced by $17.50\\nto reflect the per share amount of the special dividend pursuant to the agreement associated\\nwith the Transactions. Additionally, as a result of the acquisition of Baker Hughes, there were\\n1.7 million Baker Hughes restricted stock units (RSUs) that were\\nconverted to BHGE RSUs at a fair value of $40.18.\\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant based on the\\ncalculated fair value of the award and is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period\\nof the equity grant. The compensation cost is determined based on awards ultimately expected to vest;\\ntherefore, we have reduced the cost for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates. Forfeitures\\nare estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods to reflect actual\\nforfeitures. There were no stock-based compensation costs\\ncapitalized as the amounts were not material.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we issued 2.1 million RSUs and 1.6 million stock options under the LTI Plan. These RSUs and stock options generally vest in equal amounts over a\\nthree-year vesting period provided that the employee has remained continuously employed by the Company through\\nsuch vesting date.\\nStock based compensation expense was $37\\nmillion in 2017. Included in this amount is $15\\nmillion of expense which relates to the acceleration of equity awards upon termination\\nof employment of Baker Hughes employees with change in control agreements, and are included as part of \"Merger\\nand related costs\" in the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss). As BHGE LLC is a pass through\\nentity, any tax benefit would be recognized by its partners. Due to its cumulative losses, BHGE is unable to\\nrecognize a tax benefit on its share of stock related expenses.\\nStock Options\\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option\\npricing model. The following table presents the weighted average assumptions used in the option pricing model\\nfor options granted under the LTI Plan. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the\\noptions are expected to be outstanding. The expected life is based on a simple average of the vesting term and\\noriginal contractual term of the awards. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our\\nfive main competitors over a six year period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the observed U.S.\\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time the options were granted. The dividend yield is based on a five year\\nhistory of dividend payouts in Baker Hughes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExpected life (years)\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRisk-free interest rate\\n\\n\\n2.1\\n\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVolatility\\n\\n\\n36.4\\n\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDividend yield\\n\\n\\n1.2\\n\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWeighted average fair value per share at grant date\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n12.32\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 83\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following table presents the changes in stock options outstanding and related information\\n(in thousands, except per option prices):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nNumber of Options\\n\\n\\nWeighted Average Exercise Price Per Option (1)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConversion of Baker Hughes stock options outstanding on July 3, 2017\\n\\n\\n6,822\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n36.17\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGranted\\n\\n\\n1,626\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n36.62\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExercised\\n\\n\\n(261\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n25.66\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForfeited\\n\\n\\n(28\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n36.89\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExpired\\n\\n\\n(318\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n61.21\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOutstanding at December 31, 2017\\n\\n\\n7,841\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n35.59\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExercisable at December 31, 2017\\n\\n\\n6,243\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n35.33\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) \\n\\n\\nWeighted average exercise price for the converted stock options reflect a\\nreduction of $17.50 for the special dividend.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe weighted average remaining contractual term for options outstanding and\\noptions exercisable at December 31, 2017 were 4.3 years\\nand 2.9 years, respectively.

The number of Class A common stock\\nand Class B common stock shares outstanding at December 31, 2017 is 422 million\\nand 707 million, respectively. We have not\\nissued any preferred stock. GE owns all the issued and outstanding Class B common stock. Each share of Class A\\nand Class B common stock and the associated membership interest in BHGE LLC form a paired interest. While each\\nshare of Class B common stock has equal voting rights to a share of Class A common stock, it has no economic\\nrights, meaning holders of Class B common stock have no right to dividends and any assets in the event of\\nliquidation of the Company.\\nFormer Baker Hughes stockholders immediately after the completion of the\\nTransactions received a special one-time cash dividend of $17.50 per share paid by the Company to holders of record of the Company\\'s Class A common stock.

These activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which\\ncan adversely affect revenue earned and costs of operating our business. When the currency in which we sell\\nequipment differs from the primary currency (known as its functional currency) and the exchange rate\\nfluctuates, it will affect the revenue we earn on the sale. These sales and purchase transactions also create\\nreceivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, along with other monetary assets and liabilities,\\nwhich expose us to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes in exchange rates. Changes in the price\\nof a raw material that we use in manufacturing can affect the cost of manufacturing. We use derivatives to\\nmitigate or eliminate these exposures.\\nFORMS OF HEDGING\\nCash flow hedges\\nWe use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign exchange rate\\nchanges on purchase and sale contracts. Accordingly, the vast majority of our derivative activity in this\\ncategory consists of currency exchange contracts. We also use commodity derivatives to reduce or eliminate\\nprice risk on raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing.\\nUnder hedge accounting, the derivative carrying amount is measured at fair value each period\\nand any resulting gain or loss is recorded in a separate component of equity. Differences between the\\nderivative and the hedged item may cause changes in their fair values to not offset completely, which is\\nreferred to as ineffectiveness. When the hedged transaction occurs, these amounts are released from equity, in\\norder that the transaction will be reflected in earnings at the rate locked in by the derivative. The effect of\\nthe hedge is reported in the same financial statement line item as the earnings effects of the hedged\\ntransaction.\\nThe following table explains the effect of changes in market rates on the fair value of\\nderivatives we use most commonly in cash flow hedging arrangements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrency forwards/swaps\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nU.S. dollar strengthens\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nU.S. dollar weakens\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Pay U.S. dollars/receive foreign currency\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nFair value decreases\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nFair value increases\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEconomic Hedges\\nThese derivatives are not designated as hedges from an accounting standpoint (and therefore we\\ndo not apply hedge accounting to the relationship) but otherwise serve the same economic purpose as other\\nhedging arrangements. Some economic hedges are used when changes in the carrying amount of the hedged item are\\nalready recorded in earnings in the same period as the derivative, making hedge accounting unnecessary. For\\nsome other types of economic hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in earnings\\ncurrently but changes in the value of the forecasted foreign currency cash flows are only recognized in\\nearnings when they occur. As a result, even though the derivative is an effective economic hedge, there is a\\nnet effect on earnings in each period due to differences in the timing of earnings recognition between the\\nderivative and the hedged item.\\nThese derivatives are marked to fair value through earnings each period. The effects are\\nreported in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in the consolidated and combined statement of income\\n(loss). In general, the income (loss) effects of the hedged item are recorded in the same consolidated and\\ncombined financial statement line as the derivative. The income (loss) effect of economic hedges, after\\nconsidering offsets related to income (loss) effects of hedged assets and liabilities, is substantially offset\\nby changes in the fair value of forecasted transactions that have not yet affected income (loss).\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 89\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe table below explains the effects of market rate changes on the fair value of derivatives\\nwe use most commonly as economic hedges.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrency forwards/swaps\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nU.S. dollar strengthens\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nU.S. dollar weakens\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Pay U.S. dollars/receive foreign currency\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nFair value decreases\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nFair value increases\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Receive U.S. dollars/pay foreign currency\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nFair value increases\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nFair value decreases\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommodity derivatives\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nPrice increases\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nPrice decreases\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Receive commodity/ pay fixed price\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nFair value increases\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nFair value decreases\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNOTIONAL AMOUNT OF DERIVATIVES\\nThe notional amount of a derivative is the number of units of the underlying\\n(for example, the notional principal amount of the debt in an interest rate swap). A substantial majority of\\nthe outstanding notional amount of $10.2 billion and\\n$7.1 billion at December 31, 2017\\nand December 31, 2016, respectively, is\\nrelated to hedges of anticipated sales and purchases in foreign currency, commodity purchases, and contractual\\nterms in contracts that are considered embedded derivatives and for intercompany borrowings in foreign\\ncurrencies. We generally disclose derivative notional amounts on a gross basis to indicate the total\\ncounterparty risk. Where we have gross purchase and sale derivative contracts for a particular currency, we\\nlook to execute these contracts with the same counterparty to reduce our exposure. The corresponding net\\nnotional amounts were $3.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2016.\\nThe table below provides additional information about how derivatives are reflected in our\\nconsolidated and combined financial statements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCarrying amount related to derivatives\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDerivative assets\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n150\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n318\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDerivative liabilities\\n\\n\\n(95\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(375\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNet derivatives\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n55\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(57\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEFFECTS OF DERIVATIVES ON EARNINGS\\nAll derivatives are marked to fair value on our consolidated and combined\\nstatement of financial position, whether they are designated in a hedging relationship for accounting purposes\\nor are used as economic hedges. As discussed in the previous sections, each type of hedge affects the financial\\nstatements differently. In some economic hedges, both the hedged item and the hedging derivative offset in\\nearnings in the same period. In other economic hedges, the hedged item and the hedging derivative offset in\\nearnings in different periods. In cash flow, the effective portion of the hedging derivative is offset in\\nseparate components of equity and ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings. The table below summarizes these\\noffsets and the net effect on pre-tax earnings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nCash flow hedges\\n\\n\\nEconomic hedges\\n\\n\\nCash flow hedges\\n\\n\\nEconomic hedges\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEffect on hedging instrument\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n121\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n38\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\n(272\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEffect on underlying\\n\\n\\n(8\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(152\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n(38\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n102\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEffect on earnings (1)\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(31\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(170\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) \\n\\n\\nFor cash flow hedges, the effect on earnings, if any, is primarily related to\\nineffectiveness.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\\nGE and its affiliates have provided and continue to provide a variety of services to us.\\nIn connection with the Transactions on July 3,\\n2017, we entered into various agreements with GE and its affiliates that govern our\\nrelationship with GE following the Transactions including an Intercompany Services Agreement pursuant to which\\nGE and its affiliates and the Company will provide certain services to each other. GE will provide certain\\nadministrative services, GE proprietary technology and use of certain GE trademarks in consideration for a\\npayment of $55 million per year. GE may also provide us with\\ncertain additional administrative services under the Intercompany Services Agreement, not included as\\nconsideration for the $55 million per year payment, and the\\nfees for such services are based on actual usage of such services and historical GE intercompany pricing. In\\naddition, we will provide GE and its affiliates with confidential access to certain of our proprietary\\ntechnology and related developments and enhancements thereto related to GE\\'s operations, products or service\\nofferings. We recognized a cost of $28 million for the year\\nended December 31, 2017 for services provided by GE and its\\naffiliates subsequent to the close of the Transactions.\\nPrior to the Transactions, GE and its affiliates provided a variety of\\nservices and funding to us. The cost of these services was either (a) recognized through our allocated portion\\nof GE\\'s corporate overhead; or (b) billed directly to us. Costs of $103\\nmillion, $210 million and\\n$180 million for the year ended December\\n31, 2017, 2016 and\\n2015, respectively, were recorded in our consolidated and combined\\nstatement of income (loss) in respect of services provided by GE and its affiliates prior to the close of the\\nTransactions.\\nWe sold $639 million, $374 million and $329\\nmillion of products and services to various GE and its affiliates during the year\\nended December 31, 2017, 2016\\nand 2015, respectively. Purchases from GE\\nand its affiliates were $1,512 million, $978 million and $1,225 million during the year ended December 31, 2017,\\n2016 and 2015,\\nrespectively.\\nEMPLOYEE BENEFITS\\nCertain of our employees are covered under various GE sponsored employee benefit plans,\\nincluding GE\\'s retirement plans (pension, retiree health and life insurance, and savings benefit plans) and\\nactive health and life insurance benefit plans. Further details are provided in \"Note 9. Employee Benefit\\nPlans.\"\\nRELATED PARTY BALANCES\\nIn connection with the Transactions, as of July 3,\\n2017, we were required to repay any cash in excess of $100\\nmillion, net of any third-party debt in GE O&G, to GE. Due to the restricted\\nnature of the majority of this excess cash, we continue to hold this cash on behalf of GE until such cash is\\nunrestricted and available for repayment to GE. The restriction arises as the majority of the cash cannot be\\nreleased, transferred or otherwise converted into a non-restricted market currency due to the lack of market\\nliquidity, capital controls or similar monetary or exchange limitations by a Government entity of the\\njurisdiction in which such cash is situated. Accordingly, on July 3,\\n2017, we executed a promissory note with GE.  There is no maturity date on the\\npromissory note, but we remain obligated to repay GE such excess cash together with any income or loss we may\\nincur on it, therefore, this obligation is reflected as short-term borrowings. As of December 31, 2017, of the\\namount due to GE of $1,124 million, $997 million was held in the form of cash and $127\\nmillion was held in the form of investment securities. A corresponding liability is\\nreported in short-term borrowings in the consolidated and combined statements of financial\\nposition.\\nRECEIVABLES MONETIZATION\\nWe monetized a portion of our current receivables through programs established for GE and\\nvarious GE subsidiaries. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we ceased to participate in the GE\\nreceivables monetization program.\\nUnder the receivable monetization program, we factored U.S. and non-U.S. receivables to GE\\nCapital on a recourse and nonrecourse basis pursuant to various factoring and services agreements, purchased\\ndirectly by Working Capital Solutions (WCS), an operating unit of GE Capital or sold to external investors\\nthrough WCS agent arranger or buy/sell structures. Under the factoring programs, GE Capital performed a risk\\nanalysis and allocated a\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 94\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnonrecourse credit limit for each customer. If the portfolio exceeded this\\ncredit limit, then the receivable was factored with recourse. The evaluation of whether recourse transactions\\nqualify for accounting derecognition is based, in part, upon the legal jurisdiction of the sales, as such, the\\nmajority of recourse transactions outside the U.S. qualify for sale treatment. The Company has\\n$116 million and $198 million\\nat December 31, 2017 and\\nDecember 31, 2016, respectively, of accounts payable to GE that\\nrelate to cash collected on current receivables under this monetization program. In addition, prior to the\\nTransactions, we participated in the GE Accounts Receivable (GEAR) program, in which we transferred our\\nreceivables into a securitization structure administered by GE Capital through the GE Receivables and Sale\\nContribution Agreement.\\nThe outstanding balances of receivables that were transferred to GE under\\nWCS administered programs and are accounted for as sales were $225 million\\nand $2,168 million as of December 31, 2017\\nand 2016, respectively.\\nUnder the programs, we retain the responsibility for servicing the\\nreceivables and remitting collections to the owner and the lenders for a fee equal to the prevailing market\\nrate for such services. We have outsourced our servicing responsibilities to GE Capital for a market-based fee\\nand accordingly, no servicing asset or liability has been recorded on the consolidated and combined statements\\nof financial position as of December 31, 2017 and\\nDecember 31, 2016. Under the programs, we incurred interest expense\\nand finance charges of $59 million, $91 million and $93 million for the years ended December 31, 2017,\\n2016 and 2015,\\nrespectively, which is reflected in the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss).\\nTRADE PAYABLES ACCELERATED PAYMENT PROGRAM\\nOur North American operations participate in accounts payable programs with\\nGE Capital. Invoices are settled with vendors per our payment terms to obtain cash discounts. GE Capital\\nprovides funding for invoices eligible for a cash discount. Our liability associated with the funded\\nparticipation in the accounts payable programs, which is presented as accounts payable within the consolidated\\nand combined statements of financial position, was $293 million and $104 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31,\\n2016, respectively.\\nPARENT\\'S NET INVESTMENT\\nAt December 31, 2016, the\\nremainder of GE\\'s total investment, in excess of our debt from GE, is reflected as equity under the caption\\n\"Parent\\'s net investment\" in our consolidated and combined statements of financial position. At\\nDecember 31, 2017, GE\\'s equity ownership is reflected in\\nnoncontrolling interest in our consolidated and combined statements of financial position.\\nOTHER\\nThe Company has $575 million and $228 million of accounts payable at\\nDecember 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for services provided by GE in the ordinary course of\\nbusiness. The Company has $801 million and\\n$392 million of current receivables at December 31, 2017 and 2016,\\nrespectively, for services provided to GE in the ordinary course of business.\\nPrior to the Transactions, GE provided guarantees, letters of credit, and other support\\narrangements on our behalf. We provide guarantees to GE Capital on behalf of some customers who have entered\\ninto financing arrangements with GE Capital.\\nPrior to the Transactions, a certain number of our employees were granted GE stock options and\\nRSUs under GE\\'s 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Our consolidated and combined financial statements include\\ncompensation expense related to these awards for the portion of an employee\\'s vesting period that accrued\\nduring employment with us.\\nINCOME TAXES\\nAt closing, BHGE, GE and BHGE LLC entered into a Tax Matters Agreement. The Tax Matters\\nAgreement governs the administration and allocation between the parties of tax liabilities and benefits arising\\nprior to, as a result of, and subsequent to the Transactions, including certain restructuring transactions in\\nconnection therewith,\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 95\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of GE and BHGE,\\nwith respect to various other tax matters. GE will be responsible for certain taxes related to the formation of\\nthe transaction undertaken by GE and Baker Hughes and their respective subsidiaries. GE has assumed\\napproximately $33 million of tax obligations of Baker Hughes\\nrelated to the formation of the transaction.\\nFollowing the closing of the Transactions, BHGE or BHGE LLC (or their respective subsidiaries)\\nmay be included in group tax returns with GE. To the extent included in such group tax returns, (i) GE will be\\nrequired to pay BHGE or BHGE LLC to the extent such separate tax returns include net operating losses that are\\nused to reduce taxes payable by GE with respect to the applicable group tax return, and (ii) BHGE or BHGE LLC\\nwill be required to make tax sharing payments to GE in an amount intended to approximate the amount that such\\nentity would have paid if it had not been included in such group tax returns and had filed separate tax\\nreturns.\\nThe Tax Matters Agreement also provides for the sharing of certain tax\\nbenefits (i) arising from the Transactions, including restructuring transactions, and (ii) resulting from\\nallocations of tax items by BHGE LLC. GE is entitled to 100% of these tax benefits to the extent that GE has borne certain taxes related to the formation of the\\ntransaction which are currently estimated to be $33 million.\\nThereafter, these tax benefits will be shared by GE and BHGE in accordance with their economic ownership of\\nBHGE LLC, which will initially be approximately 62.5% and\\napproximately 37.5%, respectively. The sharing of tax\\nbenefits generally is expected to result in cash payments by BHGE LLC to its members. Any such cash payments\\nmay be subject to adjustment based on certain subsequent events, including tax audits or other determinations\\nas to the availability of the tax benefits with respect to which such cash payments were previously\\nmade.\\n\\nNOTE 17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\\nLEASES\\nAt December 31, 2017, we\\nhad long-term non-cancelable operating leases covering certain facilities and equipment. The minimum annual\\nrental commitments, net of amounts due under subleases, for each of the five years in the period ending\\nDecember 31, 2021 are $156 million, $119 million, $95 million, $76 million and $54\\nmillion, respectively, and $188 million in the aggregate thereafter. Rent expense was $360 million, $200 million and $206\\nmillion for the years ended December 31,\\n2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We did not enter into any significant capital leases during\\nthe three years ended December 31, 2017.\\nLITIGATION\\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of the conduct of our business.\\nThe ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent\\nuncertainties. We record a liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the\\namount can be reasonably estimated, including accruals for self-insured losses which are calculated based on\\nhistorical claim data, specific loss development factors and other information.\\nA range of total possible losses for all litigation matters cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nBased on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, we do not expect the ultimate outcome of\\ncurrently pending lawsuits or claims against us, other than those discussed below, will have a material adverse\\neffect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, however, there can be no assurance as to\\nthe ultimate outcome of these matters.\\nWith respect to the litigation matters below, if there was an adverse outcome individually or\\ncollectively, there could be a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations\\nexpected for the year. These litigation matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\\'s view of\\nthese matters may change in the future. Therefore, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of\\nthese matters.\\nDuring 2014, we received notification from a customer related to a possible equipment failure\\nin a natural gas storage system in Northern Germany, which includes certain of our products. We are currently\\ninvestigating the cause of the possible failure and, if necessary, possible repair and replacement options for\\nour products. Similar products were utilized in other natural gas storage systems for this and other customers.\\nThe customer initiated\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 96\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\narbitral proceedings against us on June 19, 2015, under the rules of the\\nGerman Institute of Arbitration e.V. (DIS). On August 3, 2016, the customer amended its claims and now alleges\\ndamages of approximately $224 million plus interest at an\\nannual rate of prime + 5%. Hearings before the arbitration\\npanel were held January 16, 2017 through January 23, 2017, and March 20, 2017 through March 21, 2017. In\\naddition, on September 21, 2015, TRIUVA Kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH filed a lawsuit in the United States\\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division against the Company and Baker Hughes\\nOilfield Operations, Inc. alleging that the plaintiff is the owner of gas storage caverns in Etzel, Germany in\\nwhich the Company provided certain equipment in connection with the development of the gas storage caverns. The\\nplaintiff further alleges that the Company supplied equipment that was either defectively designed or failed to\\nwarn of risks that the equipment posed, and that these alleged defects caused damage to the plaintiff\\'s\\nproperty. The plaintiff seeks recovery of alleged compensatory and punitive damages of an unspecified amount,\\nin addition to reasonable attorneys\\' fees, court costs and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. The\\nallegations in this lawsuit are related to the claims made in the June 19, 2015 German arbitration referenced\\nabove. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of these claims.\\nOn April 30, 2015, a class and collective action lawsuit alleging that we\\nfailed to pay a nationwide class of workers overtime in compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act and North\\nDakota law was filed titled Williams et al. v. Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations,\\nInc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota.  On February 8,\\n2016, the Court conditionally certified certain subclasses of employees for collective action treatment. The\\nparties entered into a settlement agreement which was approved by the Court on December 7, 2017.  The amount of\\nthe settlement will not have a material impact on the financial results reported by the Company.\\nOn July 31, 2015, Rapid Completions LLC filed a lawsuit in federal court in the Eastern\\nDistrict of Texas against Baker Hughes Incorporated, Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc., and others\\nclaiming infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,907,936; 7,134,505; 7,543,634; 7,861,774; and 8,657,009.  On August\\n6, 2015, Rapid Completions amended its complaint to allege infringement of U.S. Patent No. 9,074,451.  On\\nSeptember 17, 2015, Rapid Completions and Packers Plus Energy Services Inc. sued Baker Hughes Canada Company in\\nthe Canada Federal Court on the related Canadian patent 2,412,072. On April 1, 2016, Rapid Completions removed\\nU.S. Patent No. 6,907,936 from its claims in the lawsuit. On April 5, 2016, Rapid Completions filed a second\\nlawsuit in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas against Baker Hughes Incorporated, Baker Hughes\\nOilfield Operations, Inc. and others claiming infringement of U.S. Patent No. 9,303,501. These patents relate\\nprimarily to certain specific downhole completions equipment. The plaintiff has requested a permanent\\ninjunction against further alleged infringement, damages in an unspecified amount, supplemental and enhanced\\ndamages, and additional relief such as attorney\\'s fees and costs.  During August and September 2016, the United\\nStates Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) agreed to institute an inter-partes review of U.S. Patent Nos\\n7,861,774; 7,134,505; 7,534,634; 6,907,936; 8,657,009; and 9,074,451. On August 29, 2017, the USPTO issued its\\nfinal written decisions in the inter-partes reviews of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,657,009 and 9,074,451 finding that\\nall claims of those patents were unpatentable. On August 31, 2017, the USPTO issued its final written decision\\nin the inter-partes review of U.S. Patent 6,907,936 - the patent dropped from the lawsuit by the plaintiffs -\\nfinding that all claims of this patent were patentable. On October 27, 2017, Rapid Completions filed its\\nnotices of appeal of the USPTO\\'s final written decision in the inter-partes review of U.S. Patent Nos.\\n8,657,009 and 9,074,451. Trial on the validity of asserted claims from Canada patent 2,412,072, was completed\\nMarch 9, 2017. On December 7, 2017, the Canadian Court issued its judgment finding the patent claims asserted\\nfrom Canada patent 2,412,072 against Baker Hughes Canada Company were invalid. On January 5, 2018, Rapid\\nCompletions filed its Notice of Appeal of the Canadian Court\\'s judgment of invalidity. At this time, we are not\\nable to predict the outcome of these claims.\\nOn May 10, 2017, a putative class action complaint was filed on behalf of\\npurported Baker Hughes stockholders in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas challenging\\nthe Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger combining Baker Hughes with GE O&G. The complaint is captioned\\nBooth Family Trust v. Baker Hughes Inc., et al., Civil\\nAction No. 4:17-cv-01457 (S.D. Tex. 2017). The complaint asserted, among other things, claims under Sections\\n14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) against Baker Hughes and\\nthe members of its board of directors and challenged the adequacy of the disclosures made in the combined proxy\\nstatement/prospectus dated as of May 9, 2017. In addition to certain unspecified damages and reimbursement of\\ncosts, the plaintiff sought to enjoin the consummation of the Transactions. On June 21, 2017, the parties\\nreached an agreement in principle to settle the Booth Family Trust litigation in exchange for the Company\\nmaking certain additional disclosures. Those disclosures were contained in an 8-K filed with the SEC on June\\n22,\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 97\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2017. On September 14, 2017, the parties filed a Stipulation of Dismissal\\nwith the Court dismissing all remaining claims of the Booth Family Trust with prejudice. The parties agreed to\\nan award of attorney\\'s fees in an amount that will not have a material impact on the financial results reported\\nby the Company.\\nFollowing consummation of the Transactions, two purported holders of shares\\nof Baker Hughes common stock, representing a total of 1,875,000 shares of common stock of Baker Hughes, filed petitions in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware\\nseeking appraisal for their shares pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.  The action\\nis captioned as follows:  GKC Strategic Value Master Fund, LP F/K/A GKC Appraisal\\nRights Master Fund, LP and Walleye Trading LLC v. Baker Hughes Incorporated, Case No.\\n2017-0769.  At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this action. \\nOn February 17, 2017, GE Infrastructure Sensing, Inc. (now known as GE\\nInfrastructure Sensing, LLC) (GEIS), a subsidiary of the Company, was served with a lawsuit filed in the\\nEastern District of New York by a company named Saniteq LLC claiming compensatory damages totalling\\n$500 million plus punitive damages of an unspecified amount. The\\ncomplaint is captioned Saniteq LLC v. GE Infrastructure Sensing,\\nInc., No. 17-cv-771 (E.D.N.Y 2017). The complaint generally alleges that GEIS breached\\na contract being negotiated between the parties and misappropriated unspecified trade secrets. At this time, we\\nare not able to predict the outcome of these claims.\\nIn January 2013, INEOS and Naphtachimie initiated expertise proceedings in\\nAix-en-Provence, France arising out of a fire at a chemical plant owned by INEOS in Lavera, France, which\\nresulted in a 15-day plant shutdown and destruction of a steam turbine, which was part of a compressor train\\nowned by Naphtachimie. INEOS and Naphtachimie claim approximately €195 million\\nin losses as a result of the incident. Two of the Company\\'s subsidiaries (and 17 other\\ncompanies) were notified to participate in the proceedings. The proceedings are ongoing, and at this time,\\nthere is no indication that the Company\\'s subsidiaries were involved in the incident. At this time, we are not\\nable to predict the outcome of these claims.\\n\\nIn late November 2017, staff of the Boston office of the SEC notified GE that they are\\nconducting an investigation of GE\\'s revenue recognition practices and internal controls over financial\\nreporting related to long-term service agreements. The scope of the SEC\\'s request may include some BHGE\\ncontracts, mainly in our TPS business. We have provided documents to GE and are cooperating with them in their\\nresponse to the SEC.\\nThe Company is reporting the following matter in compliance with SEC\\nrequirements to disclose environmental proceedings where the government is a party and that potentially involve\\nmonetary sanctions of $100,000 or greater. In January 2018,\\nKern County California issued an administrative enforcement order with a proposed penalty of\\n$130,000 for alleged violations of process safety management\\nregulations at a manufacturing facility in Taft, California that is indirectly owned by the\\nCompany.\\nWe insure against risks arising from our business to the extent deemed prudent by our\\nmanagement and to the extent insurance is available, but no assurance can be given that the nature and amount\\nof that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending or future\\nlegal proceedings or other claims. Most of our insurance policies contain deductibles or self-insured\\nretentions in amounts we deem prudent and for which we are responsible for payment. In determining the amount\\nof self-insurance, it is our policy to self-insure those losses that are predictable, measurable and recurring\\nin nature, such as claims for automobile liability, general liability and workers compensation.\\n\\n\\nBHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 98\\n\\n\\n\\nBaker Hughes, a GE company\\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\\nEstimated remediation costs are accrued using currently available facts, existing\\nenvironmental permits, technology and enacted laws and regulations. Our cost estimates are developed based on\\ninternal evaluations and are not discounted. Accruals are recorded when it is probable that we will be\\nobligated to pay for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such costs can be\\nreasonably estimated. As additional information becomes available, accruals are adjusted to reflect current\\ncost estimates. Ongoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, installation\\nof pollution control equipment and waste disposal are expensed as incurred. Where we have been identified as a\\npotentially responsible party in a U.S. federal or state Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and\\nLiability Act (\"Superfund\") site, we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs of the site. This\\nshare is based on the ratio of the estimated volume of waste we contributed to the site to the total volume of\\nwaste disposed at the site.\\nOTHER\\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have\\nentered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other\\nbank issued guarantees, which totaled approximately $3.4 billion at December 31, 2017. It is not practicable to estimate\\nthe fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is\\nlikely to have, a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also had\\ncommitments outstanding for purchase obligations for each of the five years in the period ending December 31,\\n2022 of $962 million, $45\\nmillion, $42 million,\\n$36 million and $23\\nmillion, respectively, and $13 million in the aggregate thereafter.\\n\\nNOTE 18.

As a result, we recognized a charge of $385 million, $293 million and $314 million for the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and\\nChief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls\\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by\\nthis report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded\\nthat, as of December 31, 2017, our disclosure controls and\\nprocedures (as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) were effective at a reasonable assurance\\nlevel.\\nThere has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter\\nended December 31, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our\\ninternal controls over financial reporting.\\n\\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\\nIn a presentation at the Barclays Industrial Select Conference held February 21, 2018, GE\\nChief Financial Officer Jamie Miller, in a response to a question regarding BHGE and the scheme of GE\\'s\\ndivestment program, stated \"at this point in time, we have no intent to change anything or execute prior to the\\nexpiration of any of the lockup periods.\"\\nSubsequent to the filing of our Form 8-K with the SEC on January 24, 2018 announcing the\\nresults for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, in the performance of our financial reporting control\\nprocedures, the Company identified an error relating to the calculation of the loss attributable to\\nnoncontrolling interest (NCI). The NCI calculation reflects the sharing of net income, taxes, and the impact of\\nU.S. tax reform with our noncontrolling shareholders and, in this case, impacts only the BHGE financial\\nstatements. This resulted in an understatement of the net income attributable to BHGE of $59 million in the\\nForm 8-K for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. Net income attributable to BHGE for the fourth quarter\\nof 2017, which was previously reported as a loss of $29 million (loss of $0.07 per share) in the Form 8-K, is\\n$30 million (income of $0.07 per share). Net loss attributable to BHGE for the full year of 2017, which was\\npreviously reported as a loss of $132 million (loss of $0.31 per share) in the Form 8-K, is $73 million (loss\\nof $0.17 per share).

If a Participant elects to reallocate all or a portion of such\\nParticipant\\'s Account from Index Units into Share Units, the number of Index Units allocated to such\\nParticipant\\'s Account will be reduced by the number of Index Units reallocated, and the number of Share Units\\nallocated to such Participant\\'s Account will be increased by an amount equal to (x) the product of (A) the\\nnumber of such reallocated Index Units, multiplied by (B) the closing price of a share in the Index Fund on the\\napplicable Reallocation Date, divided by (y) the closing price of a Share on the applicable Reallocation\\nDate.\\n(iii) Reallocations\\nfrom Cash Units.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant is a \"specified employee\"\\nunder Section 409A of the Code, of either the Company or an Affiliate that is treated as \"publicly traded\" for\\npurposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, the first Distribution Date following such Separation from\\nService shall occur on the later of (i) the first Distribution Date prescribed by Section 1(d)(v) (definition\\nof \"Distribution Date,\" without regard to this\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\nExhibit 10.57\\nSection 5(c)) or (ii) the first payroll date that is at least six months after such\\nSeparation from Service.

Each\\nDeferral, and each right under any Deferral, shall be exercisable, during a Participant\\'s lifetime, only by\\nsuch Participant or, if permissible under applicable law, by such Participant\\'s guardian or legal\\nrepresentative. No Deferral, and no right\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\nExhibit 10.57\\nunder any Deferral, may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered, and any\\npurported pledge, alienation, attachment or encumbrance thereof shall be void and unenforceable against the\\nCompany or any Affiliate.\\n(b) No Rights to\\nParticipation.

Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the\\nCompany or any Affiliate from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements,\\nand such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.\\n(e) No Right to\\nContinued Service. The opportunity to make a Deferral under the Plan shall not be\\nconstrued as giving a Participant the right to be employed by the Company or any Affiliate. A Participant\\'s\\nDeferral under the Plan is not intended to confer any rights on such Participant except as set forth in the\\nPlan.\\n(f) No Rights as a\\nStockholder. A Participant will have no rights as a stockholder under the terms of\\nthe Plan.\\n(g) Governing\\nLaw.

The Company will not segregate any funds or assets to\\nprovide for any distribution under the Plan. Any reserve or other asset that the Company may establish or\\nacquire to assure itself of the funds to provide payments required under the Plan shall not serve in any way as\\nsecurity to any Participant or beneficiary for the Company\\'s performance under the Plan.\\n(j) Headings. Headings are given to the Sections and subsections of the Plan\\nsolely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or\\nrelevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.\\n(k) Indemnification.

The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of\\nany other rights of indemnification to which such individuals may be entitled under the Company\\'s Certificate\\nof Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to\\nindemnify them or hold them harmless.\\n(l) Section 409A of\\nthe Code.

      "Organization and Nature of Business\n",
      "ProAssurance Corporation (ProAssurance, PRA or the Company), a Delaware\n",
      "corporation, is an insurance holding company primarily for wholly owned specialty property and casualty\n",
      "insurance entities including an entity that is the majority capital provider to Syndicate 1729 at Lloyd's of London. Risks insured are primarily liability risks\n",
      "located within the U.S. As described in more detail in Note 15, ProAssurance operates in four reportable\n",
      "segments: Specialty P&C, Workers' Compensation, Lloyd's\n",
      "Syndicate and Corporate.\n",
      "Principles of Consolidation\n",
      "The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of\n",
      "ProAssurance Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Investments in entities where ProAssurance holds a\n",
      "greater than minor interest but does not hold a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method.\n",
      "All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. ProAssurance\n",
      "subsidiaries located in the U.K. are reported on a quarter\n",
      "delay due to timing issues regarding the availability of information, except when information is available that\n",
      "is material to the current period. Furthermore, investment results associated with our FAL investments and certain U.S. paid administrative expenses are reported\n",
      "concurrently as that information is available on an earlier time frame.\n",
      "Basis of Presentation\n",
      "The preparation of financial statements in conformity with\n",
      "GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\n",
      "affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures related to these\n",
      "amounts at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n",
      "Reclassifications\n",
      "In the second quarter of 2017, ProAssurance began presenting separately the\n",
      "components of underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expense as operating expense and\n",
      "DPAC amortization on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income\n",
      "and Comprehensive Income in order to provide additional details for investors. The Consolidated Statements of\n",
      "Income and Comprehensive Income for the years ended December\n",
      "31, 2016 and 2015 have been\n",
      "reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Total underwriting, policy acquisition and\n",
      "operating expense as well as net income for all periods presented was not affected by the change in\n",
      "presentation.\n",
      "Certain other insignificant prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the\n",
      "current year presentation.\n",
      "Accounting Policies\n",
      "The significant accounting policies followed by ProAssurance in making estimates that\n",
      "materially affect financial reporting are summarized in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Recognition of Revenues\n",
      "Insurance premiums are recognized as revenues pro rata over the terms of\n",
      "the policies, which are principally one year in\n",
      "duration.\n",
      "Credit Losses\n",
      "ProAssurance's premium and agency receivables are exposed to credit losses,\n",
      "but to-date have not experienced any significant amount of credit losses. Recorded allowances for credit losses\n",
      "were less than $1.5 million at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n",
      "Neither estimated credit losses nor actual credit write-offs, net of recoveries, exceeded $0.5 million during the years ended December 31,\n",
      "2017 and 2016.\n",
      "Earned But Unbilled Premiums\n",
      "Workers' compensation premiums are determined based upon the payroll of the insured, the\n",
      "applicable premium rates and, where applicable, an experience based modification factor. An audit of the\n",
      "policyholders' records is conducted after policy expiration to make a final determination of applicable\n",
      "premiums. Audit premium due from or due to a policyholder as a result of an audit is reflected in net premiums\n",

      "premium billed in final audit invoices as a percentage of payroll exposure\n",
      "and uses this information to estimate the probable additional amount that it has earned, but not yet billed, as\n",
      "of the balance sheet date. Changes to the EBUB estimate are\n",
      "included in net premiums earned in the period recognized. As of December 31,\n",
      "2017 and 2016, ProAssurance\n",
      "carried EBUB of $4.3 million\n",
      "as a part of premiums receivable.\n",
      "Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\n",
      "ProAssurance establishes its reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses (\"reserve for\n",
      "losses\" or \"reserve\") based on estimates of the future amounts necessary to pay claims and expenses associated\n",
      "with the investigation and settlement of claims. The reserve for losses is determined on the basis of\n",
      "individual claims and payments thereon as well as actuarially determined estimates of future losses based on\n",
      "past loss experience, available industry data and projections as to future claims frequency, severity,\n",
      "inflationary trends, judicial trends, legislative changes and settlement patterns.\n",
      " Management establishes the reserve for losses\n",
      "after taking into consideration a variety of factors including the conclusions reached by internal and\n",
      "consulting actuaries, premium rates, claims frequency and severity, historical paid and incurred loss\n",
      "development trends, the expected effect of inflation, general economic trends, and the legal and political\n",
      "environment. Management updates and reviews the data underlying the estimation of the reserve for losses each\n",
      "reporting period and makes adjustments to loss estimation assumptions that best reflect emerging data. Both\n",
      "internal and consulting actuaries perform an in-depth review of the reserve for losses on at least a\n",
      "semi-annual basis using the loss and exposure data of ProAssurance's subsidiaries. Consulting actuaries provide\n",
      "reports to management regarding the adequacy of reserves.\n",
      "Estimating casualty insurance reserves, and particularly long-tailed\n",
      "insurance reserves, is a complex process. Long-tailed insurance is characterized by the extended period of time\n",
      "between collecting the premium for insuring a risk and the ultimate payment of losses. For a high proportion of\n",
      "the risks insured or reinsured by ProAssurance, the period of time required to resolve a claim is often\n",
      "five years or more, and claims may be subject to litigation.\n",
      "Estimating losses for these long-tailed claims requires ProAssurance to make and revise judgments and\n",
      "assessments regarding multiple uncertainties over an extended period of time. As a result, reserve estimates\n",
      "may vary significantly from the eventual outcome. Reserve estimates and the assumptions on which these\n",
      "estimates are predicated are regularly reviewed and updated as new information becomes available. Any\n",
      "adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations. Due to the size of ProAssurance's reserve for\n",
      "losses, even a small percentage adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on earnings in the\n",
      "period in which the adjustment is made, as was the case in 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n",
      "The effect of adjustments made to reinsured losses is mitigated by the corresponding\n",
      "adjustment that is made to reinsurance recoveries. Thus, in any given year, ProAssurance may make significant\n",
      "adjustments to gross losses that have little effect on its net losses.\n",
      "Reinsurance Receivables\n",
