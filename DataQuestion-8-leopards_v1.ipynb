      "DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\n",
      "Baker Hughes, a GE company (the Company, BHGE, we, us, or our), was formed\n",
      "on October 28, 2016, for the purpose of facilitating the combination of Baker Hughes and GE O&G. BHGE is a\n",
      "world-leading, fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of equipment and service\n",
      "capabilities. We conduct business in more than 120 countries\n",
      "and employ over 64,000 employees.\n",
      "BASIS OF PRESENTATION\n",
      "On July 3, 2017, we closed our previously announced business combination\n",
      "(the Transactions) to combine GE O&G and Baker Hughes (refer to \"Note 2. Business Acquisition\" for further\n",
      "details on the Transactions). As a result of the Transactions, the Company became the holding company of the\n",
      "combined businesses of Baker Hughes and GE O&G. Substantially all of the business of GE O&G and of\n",
      "Baker Hughes were transferred to a subsidiary of the Company, Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC (BHGE LLC),\n",
      "on July 3, 2017. GE has approximately 62.5% of economic interest in BHGE LLC and the Company has approximately\n",
      "37.5% of the remaining economic interest in BHGE LLC, held\n",
      "indirectly through two wholly owned subsidiaries. One of these wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company is the\n",
      "sole managing member of BHGE LLC. Although we hold a minority economic interest in BHGE LLC, we conduct and\n",
      "exercise full control over all activities of BHGE LLC, without the approval of any other member, through this\n",
      "wholly owned subsidiary. Accordingly, we consolidate the financial results of BHGE LLC and report a\n",
      "noncontrolling interest in our consolidated and combined financial statements for the economic interest in BHGE\n",
      "LLC not held by us. We consider BHGE LLC to be a consolidated variable interest entity (VIE). We are a holding\n",
      "company and have no material assets other than our ownership interest in BHGE LLC and certain intercompany and\n",
      "tax related balances. BHGE LLC is a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Registrant with separate filing\n",
      "requirements with the SEC and its separate financial information can be obtained from www.sec.gov. The current\n",
      "year results, and balances, may not be comparable to prior years as the current year includes the results of\n",
      "Baker Hughes from July 3, 2017.\n",
      "The accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements of the Company have been\n",
      "prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. and\n",
      "such principles, U.S. GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for annual financial\n",
      "information. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n",
      "The Company's financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis, effective July\n",

      "(entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting\n",
      "interest). All subsequent periods will also be presented on a consolidated basis. For all periods prior to July\n",
      "3, 2017, the Company's financial statements were prepared on a combined basis. The combined financial\n",
      "statements combine certain accounts of GE and its subsidiaries that were historically managed as part of its\n",
      "oil & gas business and contributed to BHGE LLC as part of the Transactions. Additionally, it also includes\n",

      "Use of Estimates\n",

      "contingent assets or liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue\n",
      "and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on\n",
      "various other assumptions and information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates\n",
      "and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty, and accordingly,\n",
      "these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is\n",
      "obtained and as our operating environment changes. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in\n",
      "the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements are appropriate, actual results could\n",
      "differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but are not limited to, determining the following:\n",
      "allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory valuation reserves; recoverability of long-lived assets,\n",
      "including revenue recognition on long term contracts, valuation of goodwill; useful lives used in depreciation\n",
      "and amortization; income taxes and related valuation allowances; accruals for contingencies; actuarial\n",
      "assumptions to determine costs and liabilities related to employee benefit plans; stock-based compensation\n",
